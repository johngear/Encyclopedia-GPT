You conclude that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think, best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that someone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table without having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as providing much more contrived explanations of the data than the one you infer to."

It could be that, as in the opening pages of Hilary Putnam’s book Reason, Truth, and History, (1981), what you see is actually the trace of an ant crawling on the beach. The much simpler, and therefore (you think) much better, explanation is that someone intentionally drew a picture of Churchill in the sand. That, in any case, is what you come away believing."

For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and Harry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that might warrant an inference from the information that you have about Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they are friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what according to a considerable number of philosophers may also warrant this conclusion, is precisely the fact that Tim and Harry’s being friends again would, if true, best explain the fact that they have just been seen jogging together. (The proviso that a hypothesis be true if it is to explain anything is taken as read from here on.) Similar remarks apply to the other two examples. The type of inference exhibited here is called abduction or, somewhat more commonly nowadays, Inference to the Best Explanation."

The distinction between deduction, on the one hand, and induction and abduction, on the other hand, corresponds to the distinction between necessary and non-necessary inferences. In deductive inferences, what is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. A familiar type of example is inferences instantiating the schema"

Differently put, it is not necessarily the case that if the premises are true, then so is the conclusion: it is logically compatible with the truth of the premises that John is a member of the minority of non-rich inhabitants of Chelsea. The case is similar regarding your inference to the conclusion that Tim and Harry are friends again on the basis of the information that they have been seen jogging together. Perhaps Tim and Harry are former business partners who still had some financial matters to discuss, however much they would have liked to avoid this, and decided to combine this with their daily exercise; this is compatible with their being firmly decided never to make up."

This would be an instance of an abductive inference. It suggests that the best way to distinguish between induction and abduction is this: both are ampliative, meaning that the conclusion goes beyond what is (logically) contained in the premises (which is why they are non-necessary inferences), but in abduction there is an implicit or explicit appeal to explanatory considerations, whereas in induction there is not; in induction, there is only an appeal to observed frequencies or statistics.

Philosophers as well as psychologists tend to agree that abduction is frequently employed in everyday reasoning. Sometimes our reliance on abductive reasoning is quite obvious and explicit. But in some daily practices, it may be so routine and automatic that it easily goes unnoticed. A case in point may be our trust in other people’s testimony, which has been said to rest on abductive reasoning; see Harman 1965, Adler 1994, Fricker 1994, and Lipton 1998 for defenses of this claim. For instance, according to Jonathan Adler (1994, 274f), “[t]he best explanation for why the informant asserts that P is normally that … he believes it for duly responsible reasons and … he intends that I shall believe it too,” which is why we are normally justified in trusting the informant’s testimony. This may well be correct, even though in coming to trust a person’s testimony one does not normally seem to be aware of any abductive reasoning going on in one’s mind. Similar remarks may apply to what some hold to be a further, possibly even more fundamental, role of abduction in linguistic practice, to wit, its role in determining what a speaker means by an utterance. Specifically, it has been argued that decoding utterances is a matter of inferring the best explanation of why someone said what he or she said in the context in which the utterance was made. Even more specifically, authors working in the field of pragmatics have suggested that hearers invoke the Gricean maxims of conversation to help them work out the best explanation of a speaker’s utterance whenever the semantic content of the utterance is insufficiently informative for the purposes of the conversation, or is too informative, or off-topic, or implausible, or otherwise odd or inappropriate; see, for instance, Bach and Harnish 1979 (92f), Dascal 1979 (167), and Hobbs 2004. As in cases of reliance on speaker testimony, the requisite abductive reasoning would normally seem to take place at a subconscious level."

Two astronomers, John Couch Adams and Urbain Leverrier, instead suggested (independently of each other but almost simultaneously) that there was an eighth, as yet undiscovered planet in the solar system; that, they thought, provided the best explanation of Uranus’ deviating orbit.

19,19,Abduction,1. Abduction: The General Idea,1.2 The ubiquity of abduction,7,abduction,"First published Wed Mar 9, 2011; substantive revision Tue May 18, 2021"," Last but not least, abduction plays a central role in some important philosophical debates. See Shalkowski 2010 on the place of abduction in metaphysics (also Bigelow 2010), Krzyżanowska, Wenmackers, and Douven 2014 and Douven 2016a for a possible role of abduction in the semantics of conditionals, and Williamson 2017 for an application of abduction in the philosophy of logic. Arguably, however, abduction plays its most notable philosophical role in epistemology and in the philosophy of science, where it is frequently invoked in objections to so-called underdetermination arguments. Underdetermination arguments generally start from the premise that a number of given hypotheses are empirically equivalent, which their authors take to mean that the evidence—indeed, any evidence we might ever come to possess—is unable to favor one of them over the others. From this, we are supposed to conclude that one can never be warranted in believing any particular one of the hypotheses. (This is rough, but it will do for present purposes; see Douven 2008 and Stanford 2009, for more detailed accounts of underdetermination arguments.) A famous instance of this type of argument is the Cartesian argument for global skepticism, according to which the hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we customarily deem it to be is empirically equivalent to a variety of so-called skeptical hypotheses (such as that we are beguiled by an evil demon, or that we are brains in a vat, connected to a supercomputer; see, e.g., Folina 2016). Similar arguments have been given in support of scientific antirealism, according to which it will never be warranted for us to choose between empirically equivalent rivals concerning what underlies the observable part of reality (van Fraassen 1980)."
20,20,Abduction,1. Abduction: The General Idea,1.2 The ubiquity of abduction,8,abduction,"First published Wed Mar 9, 2011; substantive revision Tue May 18, 2021"," Responses to these arguments typically point to the fact that the notion of empirical equivalence at play unduly neglects explanatory considerations, for instance, by defining the notion strictly in terms of hypotheses’ making the same predictions. Those responding then argue that even if some hypotheses make exactly the same predictions, one of them may still be a better explanation of the phenomena predicted. Thus, if explanatory considerations have a role in determining which inferences we are licensed to make—as according to defenders of abduction they have—then we might still be warranted in believing in the truth (or probable truth, or some such, depending—as will be seen below—on the version of abduction one assumes) of one of a number of hypotheses that all make the same predictions. Following Bertrand Russell (1912, Ch. 2), many epistemologists have invoked abduction in arguing against Cartesian skepticism, their key claim being that even though, by construction, the skeptical hypotheses make the same predictions as the hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we ordinarily take it to be, they are not equally good explanations of what they predict; in particular, the skeptical hypotheses have been said to be considerably less simple than the “ordinary world” hypothesis. See, among many others, Harman 1973 (Chs. 8 and 11), Goldman 1988 (205), Moser 1989 (161), and Vogel 1990, 2005; see Pargetter 1984 for an abductive response specifically to skepticism regarding other minds. Similarly, philosophers of science have argued that we are warranted to believe in Special Relativity Theory as opposed to Lorentz’s version of the æther theory. For even though these theories make the same predictions, the former is explanatorily superior to the latter. (Most arguments that have been given for this claim come down to the contention that Special Relativity Theory is ontologically more parsimonious than its competitor, which postulates the existence of an æther. See Janssen 2002 for an excellent discussion of the various reasons philosophers of science have adduced for preferring Einstein’s theory to Lorentz’s.)"

Explicating Abduction,,0,abduction,"First published Wed Mar 9, 2011; substantive revision Tue May 18, 2021"," Precise statements of what abduction amounts to are rare in the literature on abduction. (Peirce did propose an at least fairly precise statement; but, as explained in the supplement to this entry, it does not capture what most nowadays understand by abduction.) Its core idea is often said to be that explanatory considerations have confirmation-theoretic import, or that explanatory success is a (not necessarily unfailing) mark of truth. Clearly, however, these formulations are slogans at best, and it takes little effort to see that they can be cashed out in a great variety of prima facie plausible ways. Here we will consider a number of such possible explications, starting with what one might term the “textbook version of abduction,” which, as will be seen, is manifestly defective, and then going on to consider various possible refinements of it. What those versions have in common—unsurprisingly—is that they are all inference rules, requiring premises encompassing explanatory considerations and yielding a conclusion that makes some statement about the truth of a hypothesis. The differences concern the premises that are required, or what exactly we are allowed to infer from them (or both)."

Explicating Abduction,,2,abduction,"First published Wed Mar 9, 2011; substantive revision Tue May 18, 2021"," An observation that is frequently made about this rule, and that points to a potential problem for it, is that it presupposes the notions of candidate explanation and best explanation, neither of which has a straightforward interpretation. While some still hope that the former can be spelled out in purely logical, or at least purely formal, terms, it is often said that the latter must appeal to the so-called theoretical virtues, like simplicity, generality, and coherence with well-established theories; the best explanation would then be the hypothesis which, on balance, does best with respect to these virtues. (See, for instance, Thagard 1978 and McMullin 1996.) The problem is that none of the said virtues is presently particularly well understood. (Giere, in Callebaut (ed.) 1993 (232), even makes the radical claim that the theoretical virtues lack real content and play no more than a rhetorical role in science. In view of recent formal work both on simplicity and on coherence—for instance, Forster and Sober 1994, Li and Vitanyi 1997, and Sober 2015, on simplicity and Bovens and Hartmann 2003 and Olsson 2005, on coherence—the first part of this claim has become hard to maintain; also, Schupbach and Sprenger (2011) present an account of explanatory goodness directly in probabilistic terms. Psychological evidence casts doubt on the second part of the claim; see, for instance, Lombrozo 2007, on the role of simplicity in people’s assessments of explanatory goodness and Koslowski et al. 2008, on the role of coherence with background knowledge in those assessments.)"

Some think that abduction warrants an inference only to the probable truth of the best explanation, others that it warrants an inference only to the approximate truth of the best explanation, and still others that it warrants an inference only to the probable approximate truth."

Because abduction is ampliative—as explained earlier—it will not be a sound rule of inference in the strict logical sense, however abduction is explicated exactly. It can still be reliable in that it mostly leads to a true conclusion whenever the premises are true. An obvious necessary condition for ABD1 to be reliable in this sense is that, mostly, when it is true that H best explains E, and E is true, then H is true as well (or H is approximately true, or probably true, or probably approximately true). But this would not be enough for ABD1 to be reliable. For ABD1 takes as its premise only that some hypothesis is the best explanation of the evidence as compared to other hypotheses in a given set. Thus, if the rule is to be reliable, it must hold that, at least typically, the best explanation relative to the set of hypotheses that we consider would also come out as being best in comparison with any other hypotheses that we might have conceived (but for lack of time or ingenuity, or for some other reason, did not conceive). In other words, it must hold that at least typically the absolutely best explanation of the evidence is to be found among the candidate explanations we have come up with, for else ABD1 may well lead us to believe “the best of a bad lot” (van Fraassen 1989, 143)."

Not at all, presumably. To believe otherwise, we must assume some sort of privilege on our part to the effect that when we consider possible explanations of the data, we are somehow predisposed to hit, inter alia, upon the absolutely best explanation of those data. After all, hardly ever will we have considered, or will it even be possible to consider, all potential explanations.

For given the hypotheses we have managed to come up with, we can always generate a set of hypotheses which jointly exhaust logical space. Suppose H1,…,Hn are the candidate explanations we have so far been able to conceive. Then simply define Hn+1 := ¬H1 ∧ … ∧ ¬Hn and add this new hypothesis as a further candidate explanation to the ones we already have. Obviously, the set {H1,…,Hn+1} is exhaustive, in that one of its elements must be true. Following this in itself simple procedure would seem enough to make sure that we never miss out on the absolutely best explanation. (See Lipton 1993, for a proposal along these lines.)"

Suppose, for instance, we have as competing explanations Special Relativity Theory and Lorentz’s version of the æther theory. Then, following the above proposal, we may add to our candidate explanations that neither of these two theories is true. But surely this further hypothesis will be ranked quite low qua explanation—if it will be ranked at all, which seems doubtful, given that it is wholly unclear what its empirical consequences are. This is not to say that the suggested procedure may never work. The point is that in general it will give little assurance that the best explanation is among the candidate explanations we consider."

Or might they in some contexts rely on one version, and in others on another (Douven 2017, forthcoming)? Philosophical argumentation is unable to answer these questions. In recent years, experimental psychologists have started paying attention to the role humans give to explanatory considerations in reasoning. For instance, Tania Lombrozo and Nicholas Gwynne (2014) report experiments showing that how a property of a given class of things is explained to us—whether mechanistically, by reference to parts and processes, or functionally, by reference to functions and purposes—matters to how likely we are to generalise that property to other classes of things (see also Sloman 1994 and Williams and Lombrozo 2010). And Igor Douven and Jonah Schupbach (2015a), (2015b) present experimental evidence to the effect that people’s probability updates tend to be influenced by explanatory considerations in ways that makes them deviate from strictly Bayesian updates (see below).

Other arguments against abduction are claimed to be independent of the exact explication of the rule; below, these arguments will be found wanting. On the other hand, arguments that have been given in favor of abduction—some of which will also be discussed below—do not discern between specific versions. So, supposing people do indeed commonly rely on abduction, it must be considered an open question as to which version(s) of abduction they rely on. Equally, supposing it is rational for people to rely on abduction, it must be considered an open question as to which version, or perhaps versions, of abduction they ought to, or are at least permitted to, rely on."

(See Koehler 1991, for a survey of some of these studies; see also Brem and Rips 2000.) More telling still, Lombrozo (2007) shows that, in some situations, people tend to grossly overrate the probability of simpler explanations compared to more complicated ones. Although these studies are not directly concerned with abduction in any of the forms discussed so far, they nevertheless suggest that taking into account explanatory considerations in one’s reasoning may not always be for the better. (It is to be noted that Lombrozo’s experiments are directly concerned with some proposals that have been made for explicating abduction in a Bayesian framework; see Section 4.)

It starts by underlining the theory-dependency of scientific methodology, which comprises methods for designing experiments, for assessing data, for choosing between rival hypotheses, and so on. For instance, in considering possible confounding factors from which an experimental setup has to be shielded, scientists draw heavily on already accepted theories. The argument next calls attention to the apparent reliability of this methodology, which, after all, has yielded, and continues to yield, impressively accurate theories. In particular, by relying on this methodology, scientists have for some time now been able to find ever more instrumentally adequate theories. Boyd then argues that the reliability of scientific methodology is best explained by assuming that the theories on which it relies are at least approximately true.

An argument is premise-circular if its conclusion is amongst its premises. A rule-circular argument, by contrast, is an argument of which the conclusion asserts something about an inferential rule that is used in the very same argument. As Psillos urges, Boyd’s argument is rule-circular, but not premise-circular, and rule-circular arguments, Psillos contends, need not be viciously circular (even though a premise-circular argument is always viciously circular). To be more precise, in his view, an argument for the reliability of a given rule R that essentially relies on R as an inferential principle is not vicious, provided that the use of R does not guarantee a positive conclusion about R’s reliability. Psillos claims that in Boyd’s argument, this proviso is met. For while Boyd concludes that the background theories on which scientific methodology relies are approximately true on the basis of an abductive step, the use of abduction itself does not guarantee the truth of his conclusion. After all, granting the use of abduction does nothing to ensure that the best explanation of the success of scientific methodology is the approximate truth of the relevant background theories.

For suppose that some scientific community relied not on abduction but on a rule that we may dub “Inference to the Worst Explanation” (IWE), a rule that sanctions inferring to the worst explanation of the available data. We may safely assume that the use of this rule mostly would lead to the adoption of very unsuccessful theories. Nevertheless, the said community might justify its use of IWE by dint of the following reasoning: “Scientific theories tend to be hugely unsuccessful. These theories were arrived at by application of IWE. That IWE is a reliable rule of inference—that is, a rule of inference mostly leading from true premises to true conclusions—is surely the worst explanation of the fact that our theories are so unsuccessful. Hence, by application of IWE, we may conclude that IWE is a reliable rule of inference.” While this would be an utterly absurd conclusion, the argument leading up to it cannot be convicted of being viciously circular anymore than Boyd’s argument for the reliability of abduction can (if Psillos is right).

And there is plenty of reason to doubt the reliability of IWE; in fact, the above argument supposes that it is unreliable. Two questions arise, however. First, why should we accept the additional condition? Second, do we really have no reason to doubt the reliability of abduction? Certainly some of the abductive inferences we make lead us to accept falsehoods. How many falsehoods may we accept on the basis of abduction before we can legitimately begin to distrust this rule?

Sometimes the point is, more modestly, to assure or reassure oneself that the position one endorses, or is tempted to endorse, is correct. In the case at hand, we need not think of Boyd’s argument as an attempt to convince the opponent of abduction of its reliability.

Abduction, in whichever version, assigns a confirmation-theoretic role to explanation: explanatory considerations contribute to making some hypotheses more credible, and others less so. By contrast, Bayesian confirmation theory makes no reference at all to the concept of explanation. Does this imply that abduction is at loggerheads with the prevailing doctrine in confirmation theory? Several authors have recently argued that not only is abduction compatible with Bayesianism, it is a much-needed supplement to it. The so far fullest defense of this view has been given by Lipton (2004, Ch. 7); as he puts it, Bayesians should also be “explanationists” (his name for the advocates of abduction). (For other defenses, see Okasha 2000, McGrew 2003, Weisberg 2009, and Poston 2014, Ch. 7; for discussion, see Roche and Sober 2013, 2014, and McCain and Poston 2014.)"

For what could it mean for a Bayesian to be an explanationist? In order to apply Bayes’ rule and determine the probability for H after learning E, the Bayesian agent will have to determine the probability of H conditional on E. For that, he needs to assign unconditional probabilities to H and E as well as a probability to E given H; the former two are mostly called “prior probabilities” (or just “priors”) of, respectively, H and E, the latter the “likelihood” of H on E. (This is the official Bayesian story. Not all of those who sympathize with Bayesianism adhere to that story. For instance, according to some it is more reasonable to think that conditional probabilities are basic and that we derive unconditional probabilities from them; see Hájek 2003, and references therein.) How is the Bayesian to determine these values? As is well known, probability theory gives us more probabilities once we have some; it does not give us probabilities from scratch. Of course, when H implies E or the negation of E, or when H is a statistical hypothesis that bestows a certain chance on E, then the likelihood follows “analytically.” (This claim assumes some version of Lewis’ (1980) Principal Principle, and it is controversial whether or not this principle is analytic; hence the scare quotes.) But this is not always the case, and even if it were, there would still be the question of how to determine the priors. This is where, according to Lipton, abduction comes in. In his proposal, Bayesians ought to determine their prior probabilities and, if applicable, likelihoods on the basis of explanatory considerations."

The answer to this question is not as simple as one might at first think. Suppose you are considering what priors to assign to a collection of rival hypotheses and you wish to follow Lipton’s suggestion. How are you to do this? An obvious—though still somewhat vague—answer may seem to go like this: Whatever exact priors you are going to assign, you should assign a higher one to the hypothesis that explains the available data best than to any of its rivals (provided there is a best explanation). Note, though, that your neighbor, who is a Bayesian but thinks confirmation has nothing to do with explanation, may well assign a prior to the best explanation that is even higher than the one you assign to that hypothesis. In fact, his priors for best explanations may even be consistently higher than yours, not because in his view explanation is somehow related to confirmation—it is not, he thinks—but, well, just because. In this context, “just because” is a perfectly legitimate reason, because any reason for fixing one’s priors counts as legitimate by Bayesian standards. According to mainstream Bayesian epistemology, priors (and sometimes likelihoods) are up for grabs, meaning that one assignment of priors is as good as another, provided both are coherent (that is, they obey the axioms of probability theory). Lipton’s recommendation to the Bayesian to be an explanationist is meant to be entirely general. But what should your neighbor do differently if he wants to follow the recommendation? Should he give the same prior to any best explanation that you, his explanationist neighbor, give to it, that is, lower his priors for best explanations? Or rather should he give even higher priors to best explanations than those he already gives?"

The answer to the question of how explanatory considerations are to guide one’s choice of priors would then presumably be that one ought to assign a higher prior to the best explanation than to its rivals, if this is not what one already does.

If there are already data in, then, clearly, one may assign higher priors to hypotheses that best explain the then-available data. However, one can sensibly speak of “best explanations” even before any data are known. For example, one hypothesis may be judged to be a better explanation than any of its rivals because the former requires less complicated mathematics, or because it is stated in terms of familiar concepts only, which is not true of the others. More generally, such judgments may be based on what Kosso (1992, 30) calls internal features of hypotheses or theories, that is, features that “can be evaluated without having to observe the world.”)"

We said that mainstream Bayesians regard one assignment of prior probabilities as being as good as any other. So-called objective Bayesians do not do so, however. These Bayesians think priors must obey principles beyond the probability axioms in order to be admissible. Objective Bayesians are divided among themselves over exactly which further principles are to be obeyed, but at least for a while they agreed that the Principle of Indifference is among them. Roughly stated, this principle counsels that, absent a reason to the contrary, we give equal priors to competing hypotheses. As is well known, however, in its original form the Principle of Indifference may lead to inconsistent assignments of probabilities and so can hardly be advertised as a principle of rationality. The problem is that there are typically various ways to partition logical space that appear plausible given the problem at hand, and that not all of them lead to the same prior probability assignment, even assuming the Principle of Indifference. Weisberg’s proposal amounts to the claim that explanatory considerations may favor some of those partitions over others. Perhaps we will not always end up with a unique partition to which the Principle of Indifference is to be applied, but it would already be progress if we ended up with only a handful of partitions. For we could then still arrive in a motivated way at our prior probabilities, by proceeding in two steps, namely, by first applying the Principle of Indifference to the partitions separately, thereby possibly obtaining different assignments of priors, and by then taking a weighted average of the thus obtained priors, where the weights, too, are to depend on explanatory considerations. The result would again be a probability function—the uniquely correct prior probability function, according to Weisberg."

For another, it may be idle to hope that taking explanatory considerations into account will in general leave us with a manageable set of partitions, or that, even if it does, this will not be due merely to the fact that we are overlooking a great many prima facie plausible ways of partitioning logical space to begin with.

This suggestion is sensitive to the well-recognized fact that we are not always able to assign a prior to every hypothesis of interest, or to say how probable a given piece of evidence is conditional on a given hypothesis. Consideration of that hypothesis’ explanatory power might then help us to figure out, if perhaps only within certain bounds, what prior to assign to it, or what likelihood to assign to it on the given evidence."

In the remaining cases—they might say—we should simply refrain from applying Bayesian reasoning. A fortiori, then, there is no need for an abduction-enhanced Bayesianism in these cases. And some incontrovertible mathematical results indicate that, in the cases that fall under (a), (b), or (c), our probabilities will converge to the truth anyhow.

It is widely accepted that sometimes we speak and think about our beliefs in a categorical manner, while at other times we speak and think about them in a graded way. It is far from clear how these different ways of speaking and thinking about beliefs—the epistemology of belief and the epistemology of degrees of belief, to use Richard Foley’s (1992) terminology—are related to one another. In fact, it is an open question whether there is any straightforward connection between the two, or even whether there is a connection at all. Be that as it may, given that the distinction is undeniable, it is a plausible suggestion that, just as there are different ways of talking and thinking about beliefs, there are different ways of talking and thinking about the revision of beliefs. In particular, abduction could well have its home in the epistemology of belief, and be called upon whenever we reason about our beliefs in a categorical mode, while at the same time Bayes’ rule could have its home in the epistemology of degrees of belief. Hard-nosed Bayesians may insist that whatever reasoning goes on in the categorical mode must eventually be justifiable in Bayesian terms, but this presupposes the existence of bridge principles connecting the epistemology of belief with the epistemology of degrees of belief—and, as mentioned, whether such principles exist is presently unclear."

After his recovery, Abelard resumed teaching at a nearby priory, primarily on theology and in particular on the Trinity. His method of philosophical analysis was seen as a direct challenge to more traditional approaches, and a synod, convened in Soissons to examine Abelard’s writings, condemned them and required Abelard to make a public avowal of faith, an experience he found humiliating; shortly afterwards he was allowed to settle in a wild and uninhabited section of land, to devote himself to contemplation."

It was during this time that his theological treatises were brought to the attention of Bernard of Clairvaux, who objected to some of Abelard’s conclusions as well as to his approach to matters of faith. After some inconclusive attempts to resolve their differences, Abelard asked the archbishop of Sens to arrange a public dispute between himself and Bernard on 3 June 1140, to settle their disagreements. Bernard initially refused the invitation on the grounds that one should not debate matters of faith, but then accepted it and, unknown to Abelard, arranged to convene another commission of enquiry to review Abelard’s works on suspicion of heresy. When Abelard discovered that there was no debate but instead a kangaroo court, he refused to take part, announcing his intention to appeal to the Pope directly. He walked out of the proceedings and began travelling to Rome. The Council condemned nineteen propositions it claimed to find in his works and adjourned. Bernard launched a successful campaign petitioning the Papal Court before Abelard was out of France; a letter from the Pope upholding the decision of the Council of Soissons reached Abelard while he was at Cluny; Abelard was ordered to silence. By all accounts Abelard complied immediately, even meeting peacefully with Bernard in reconciliation. Peter the Venerable, the abbot of Cluny, wrote to the Pope about these matters, and the Pope lifted Abelard’s sentence. Abelard remained under the protection of Peter the Venerable first at Cluny, then at St. Marcel, as his health gradually deteriorated. Abelard died on 21 April 1142.

Each species is actually informed by a contrary, and the genus is actually present in each as a whole; hence it is actually informed by one contrary in one species and by the other in the other; since it is wholly one and the same in each, it is therefore actually informed by contraries, and the contradiction results. Second, Abelard undertakes to establish that contraries will be present not merely in the genus but even in the selfsame individual. For Socrates is (an) animal, and so is Brunellus the Ass; but by transitivity—since each is wholly and completely animal—Socrates is Brunellus, and hence both rational and irrational.

More precisely, Abelard holds that common nouns (such as ‘animal’), verbs, and negative names (such as ‘not-Socrates’) are correctly predicable of many, and so count as universals. These terms are semantically general, in that their sense applies to more than one thing, but they do not thereby name some general thing; instead, they distributively refer to each of the individuals to which the term applies. For example, the term ‘animal’ has the sense living substance, which is inherently general, and it refers to each individual animal since each is a living substance—as Abelard puts it, since each has the status of being a living substance.

The matter of something is that out of which it is made, whether it persists in the finished product (as bricks in a house) or is absorbed into it (as flour in bread). Ultimately, all material objects are composed of the four elements earth, air, fire, and water, but they do not retain their elemental forms in most combinations. In general, the form of a material object just is the configuration of its material parts: “We call the form strictly what comes from the composition of the parts.” The form of a statue, for example, is its shape, which is no more than the arrangement of its matter—the curve of the nose, the size of the eyes, and so on. Forms are therefore supervenient on matter, and have no ontological standing independent of it. This is not to deny that forms exist, but to provide a particular explanation of what it is for a form to inhere in a given subject, namely for that subject to have its matter configured in a certain way. For example, the inherence of shape in the statue just is the way in which its bronze is arranged. Hence material things are identical with what they are made of—with one exception: human beings, whose forms are their immaterial (and immortal) souls. Strictly speaking, since human souls are capable of existence in separation form the body, they are not forms after all, though they act as substantial forms as long as they are joined to the body."

Abelard countenances many types of integral wholes: collections, no matter how their members are selected; structured composites, whether naturally unified (such as Socrates and his limbs) or artificially unified (such as the walls, floor, and roof of a house); continuous quantities that are homogeneous material ‘substances,’ namely stuffs, such as water or gold; geometrical objects, such as lines, defined by the relative position of their parts; temporal wholes, such as a day and the hours that make it up. Most of these wholes are ontologically nothing beyond their material parts. Whether structured composites have any independent ontological standing depends on the status of their organizing forms."

Intuitively, some wholes have a natural division that takes precedence over others; a sentence, for example, is divided into words, syllables, and letters, in precisely that order. According to Abelard, the principal parts of a whole are those whose conjunction immediately results in the complete whole. His intent seems to be that the nature of the composition (if any) that defines the integral whole also spells out its principal parts. A house consists of floor, walls, and roof put together in the right way. It is an open question whether each principal part (such as the wall) requires the existence of all of its subparts (every brick). The principal parts of a collection, for example, are just each of the members of the collection, whatever may be the case with any given member’s subparts; the principal parts of an aggregation are the members located in proximity to one another."

But an individual’s nature is not something really shared with or common to other individuals; Abelard’s refutation of realism has shown that this is impossible. Instead, Abelard takes a natural kind to be a well-defined collection of things that have the same features, broadly speaking, that make them what they are. Why a given thing has some features rather than others is explained by how it got that way—the natural processes that created it result in its having the features it does, namely being the kind of thing it is; similar processes lead to similar results. On this reading, it is clear that natural kinds have no special status; they are no more than discrete integral wholes whose principle of membership is similarity, merely reflecting the fact that the world is divided into discrete similarity-classes of objects. Furthermore, such real relations of similarity are nothing themselves above and beyond the things that are similar. The division into natural kinds is, presumably, a ‘shallow fact’ about the world: matters could have been otherwise had God ordained them differently; fire might be cold, heavy bodies fall upwards, frogs reason. If these causal powers were different, then natural kinds might be different as well, or might not have been as sharply differentiated as they are now. Given how matters stand, natural kinds carve the world at its joints, but they are the joints chosen by God."

Logic,,12,abelard,"First published Tue Aug 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Aug 12, 2022"," Abelard observes that the same propositional content can be expressed with different force in different contexts: the content that Socrates is in the house is expressed in an assertion in ‘Socrates is in the house’; in a question in ‘Is Socrates in the house?’; in a wish in ‘If only Socrates were in the house!’ and so on. Hence Abelard can distinguish in particular the assertive force of a sentence from its propositional content, a distinction that allows him to point out that the component sentences in a conditional statement are not asserted, though they have the same content they do when asserted—‘If Socrates is in the kitchen, then Socrates is in the house’ does not assert that Socrates is in the kitchen or that he is in the house, nor do the antecedent or the consequent, although the same form of words could be used outside the scope of the conditional to make such assertions. Likewise, the distinction allows Abelard to define negation, and other propositional connectives, purely truth-functionally in terms of content, so that negation, for instance, is treated as follows: not-p is false/true if and only if p is true/false."

Logic,,13,abelard,"First published Tue Aug 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Aug 12, 2022"," The key to the theory of argument, for Abelard, is found in inferentia, best rendered as ‘entailment’, since Abelard requires the connection between the propositions involved to be both necessary and relevant. That is, the conclusion—more exactly, the sense of the final statement—is required by the sense of the preceding statement(s), so that it cannot be otherwise. Abelard often speaks of the sense of the final statement being “contained” in the sense of the preceding statement(s), much as we speak of the conclusion being contained in the premisses. An entailment is complete (perfecta) when it holds in virtue of the logical form (complexio) of the propositions involved. By this, Abelard tells us, he means that the entailment holds under any uniform substitution in its terms, the criterion now associated with Bolzano. The traditional four figures and moods of the categorical syllogism derived from Aristotle, and the doctrine of the hypothetical syllogism derived from Boethius, are all instances of complete entailments, or as we should say, valid inference."

The necessary connection among the propositions, and the link among their senses, might be a function of non-formal metaphysical truths holding in all possible worlds. For instance, human beings are a kind of animal, so the consequence ‘If Socrates is a human being, Socrates is an animal’ holds of necessity and the sense of the antecedent compels that of the consequent, but it is not formally valid under uniform substitution. Abelard takes such incomplete entailments to hold according to the theory of the topics (to be forms of so-called topical inference). The sample inference above is validated by the topic “from the species”, a set of metaphysical relations one of which is expressible in the rule “Whatever the species is predicated of, so too is the genus” which grounds the inferential force of the entailment. Against Boethius, Abelard maintained that topical rules were only needed for incomplete entailment, and in particular are not required to validate the classical moods of the categorical and hypothetical syllogism mentioned in the preceding paragraph."

Abelard usually, though not always, treats compound names such as ‘street-sweeper’ reductively. Even so his list is not general enough to catalogue all referring expressions.

In reply Abelard clearly draws a distinction between two semantic properties names possess: reference (nominatio), a matter of what the term applies to; and sense (significatio), a matter of what hearing the term brings to mind, or more exactly the informational content (doctrina) of the concept the word is meant to give rise to, a causal notion.

Therefore, proper names are semantically singular referring expressions, closely allied to indexicals, demonstratives, and singular descriptions (or descriptive terms). Common names, by contrast, are semantically allied with expressions that have what Abelard calls “plural signification”. On the one hand, common names are like plural nouns; the common name ‘man’ is grammatically singular but operates like the plural term ‘men’—each refers to every man, although the plural term signifies individuals as part of a collection, whereas the common name distributively refers to each individual. On the other hand, common names are like terms such as ‘trio’ or ‘pair’ in that they pick out a determinate plurality of individuals, but only on an occasion of use, since their extension is variable."

Abelard holds that the signification of a term is the informational content of the concept that is associated with the term upon hearing it, in the normal course of events. Since names are only conventionally significant, which concept is associated with a given name depends in part on the psychological conditioning of language-users, in virtue of which Abelard can treat signification as both a causal and a normative notion: the word ‘rabbit’ ought to cause native speakers of English to have the concept of a rabbit upon hearing it. Abelard is careful to insist that the signification is a matter of the informational content carried in the concept—mere psychological associations, even the mental images characteristic of a given concept, are not part of what the word means. Ideally, the concept will correspond to a real definition that latches onto the nature of the thing, the way ‘rational mortal animal’ is thought to be the real definition of ‘human being’, regardless of other associated features (even necessary features such as risibility) or fortuitous images (as any mental image of a human will be of someone with determinate features). Achieving such clarity in our concepts is, of course, an arduous business, and requires an understanding of how understanding itself works (see the discussion of Abelard’s philosophy of mind in  Section 5).  Yet one point should be clear from the example. The significations of some names, such as those corresponding to natural-kind terms, are abstractions in the sense that they include only certain features of the things to which the term refers. They do not positively exclude all other features, though, and are capable of further determinate specification: ‘rational mortal animal’ as the content of the concept of ‘human being’ signifies all humans, whatever their further features may be—tall or short, fat or thin, male or female, and so on."

Philosophy of Language,,28,abelard,"First published Tue Aug 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Aug 12, 2022"," What holds for the semantics of names applies for the most part to verbs. The feature that sets verbs apart from names, more so than tense or grammatical person, is that verbs have connective force (vis copulativa). This is a primitive and irreducible feature of verbs that can only be discharged when they are joined with names in the syntactically appropriate way, reminiscent of the ‘unsaturatedness’ of concepts in Frege. Sentences are made up of names and verbs in such a way that the meaning of the whole sentence is a function of the meaning of its parts. That is, Abelardian semantics is fundamentally compositional in nature. The details of how the composition works are complex. Abelard works directly with a natural language (Latin) that, for all its artificiality, is still a native second tongue. Hence there are many linguistic phenomena Abelard is compelled to analyze that would be simply disallowed in a more formal framework."

Philosophy of Language,,29,abelard,"First published Tue Aug 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Aug 12, 2022"," For example, Abelard notes that most verbs can occur as predicates in two ways, namely as a finite verbal form or as a nominal form combined with an auxiliary copula, so that we may say either ‘Socrates runs’ or ‘Socrates is running’; the same holds for transitive predication, for instance ‘Socrates hits Plato’ and ‘Socrates is hitting Plato.’ Abelard argues that in general the pure verbal version of predication is the fundamental form, which explains and clarifies the extended version; the latter is only strictly necessary where simple verbal forms are lacking. (The substantive verb ‘is’ requires special treatment.) Hence for Abelard the basic analysis of a predicative statement recognizes that two fundamentally different linguistic categories are joined together: the name n and the simple verbal function V( ), combined in the well-formed sentence V(n)."

First, a sentence such as ‘Socrates runs’ deals with Socrates and with running, not with anyone’s understandings. We talk about the world, not merely someone’s understanding of the world. Second, sentences like ‘If something is human, it is an animal’ are false if taken to be about understandings, for someone could entertain the concept human without entertaining the concept animal, and so the antecedent would obtain without the consequent. Third, understandings are evanescent particulars, mere mental tokenings of concepts. But at least some consequential sentences are necessary, and necessity can’t be grounded on things that are transitory, and so not on understandings. Sentences must therefore signify something else in addition to understandings, something that can do what mere understandings cannot. Abelard describes this as signifying what the sentence says, calling what is said by the sentence its dictum (plural dicta)."

But Abelard will have nothing to do with any such entities. He declares repeatedly and emphatically that despite being more than and different from the sentences that express them, dicta have no ontological standing whatsoever. In the short space of a single paragraph he says that they are “no real things at all” and twice calls them “absolutely nothing.” They underwrite sentences, but they aren’t real things. For although a sentence says something, there is not some thing that it says. The semantic job of sentences is to say something, which is not to be confused with naming or denoting some thing. It is instead a matter of proposing how things are, provided this is not given a realist reading. Likewise, the truth of true sentences is not a property inhering in some timeless entity, but no more than the assertion of what the sentence says—that is, Abelard adopts a deflationary account of truth. A sentence is true if things stand in the way it says, and things make sentences true or false in virtue of the way they are (as well as in virtue of what the sentences say), and nothing further is required. The sentence ‘Socrates runs’ is true because Socrates runs, which is all that can be said or needs to be said."

Abelard rejects each of these theories and proposes instead an adverbial theory of thought, showing that neither mental images nor mental contents need be countenanced as ontologically independent of the mind.

The inherence of the form in matter makes the matter to be a thing of a certain kind, so that the inherence of the form cat in matter produces an actual cat, whereas the (immaterial) inherence of the form cat in the mind transforms the mind into an understanding of a cat: the mind becomes (formally) identical with its object. Since the ‘aboutness’ of understanding is analyzed as the commonness or identity of form in the understanding and the thing understood, we may call this approach the conformality theory of understanding. This theory captures the intuition that understanding somehow inherits or includes properties of what is understood, by reducing the intentionality of understanding to the objective identity of the form in the mind and the form in the world."

For an understanding to be about some thing, such as a cat, is for there to be an occurrent concept in the mind that is a natural likeness of a cat. The motivation for calling the likeness “natural” is to guarantee that the resemblance between the understanding and what is understood is objective, and that all persons have access to the same stock of concepts. (The conformality theory does this by postulating the objective existence of forms in things and by an identical process in all persons of assimilating or acquiring forms.) We may call this approach the resemblance theory of understanding: mental acts are classified according to the distinct degree and kind of resemblance they have to the things that are understood."

For example, a concept is clearly immaterial, and as such radically differs from any material object. Furthermore, there seems to be no formal characteristic of a mental act in virtue of which it can non-trivially be said to resemble anything else. To get around these difficulties, mediaeval philosophers, like the British Empiricists centuries later, appealed to a particular kind of resemblance, namely pictorial resemblance. A portrait of Socrates is about Socrates in virtue of visually resembling Socrates in the right ways. And just as there are pictorial images that are about their subjects, so too are there mental images that are about things. These mental images, whether they are concepts or are contained in concepts, explain the way in which a concept is ‘about’ an object. For an understanding to be about a cat is for it to be or contain a mental image of a cat. The phenomenon of mental ‘aboutness’ is explicated by the more familiar case of pictorial aboutness, itself reduced to a real relation of resemblance."

Consider a tower, which is a material object with a certain length, depth, and height; assume that these features compose its form, much as the shape of a statue is its form. According to Aristotelian metaphysics, the inherence of a form in a subject makes the subject into something characterized by that form, as for instance whiteness inhering in Socrates makes him something white. The forms of the tower likewise make that in which they inhere to be tall, wide, massive—all physical properties. If these forms inhere in the mind, then, they should make the mind tall, wide, and massive, an absurd conclusion: the mind “cannot extend itself in length or width.” Yet it is a cardinal thesis of the conformality theory that the mind has the identical form that is possessed by the external object, the tower, although the form of (say) length is by its very nature physical. Thus, Abelard concludes, conformality is incoherent."
124,124,Peter Abelard,5. Philosophy of Mind,,39,abelard,"First published Tue Aug 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Aug 12, 2022"," Abelard’s main objection to the resemblance theory is that mental images qua images, like any sign, are inert: they require interpretation. A sign is just an object. It may be taken in a significative role, though it need not be. Abelard notes that this distinction holds equally for non-mental signs: we can treat a statue as a lump of bronze or as a likeness. Mental images are likewise inert. For a sign to function significatively, then, something more is required beyond its mere presence or existence. But the resemblance theory doesn’t recognize the need to interpret the mental image as an image, and thereby mistakenly identifies understanding with the mere presence of a mental image in the mind. Abelard concludes that mental images have only an instrumental role in thought, describing them as “intermediary signs of things” (intersigna rerum). Intentionality derives instead from the act of attention (attentio) directed upon the mental image. Proof is found in the fact that that we can “vary the understanding” simply by attending to different features of the mental image: the selfsame image—say, a fig tree—can be used to think about this very fig tree, or trees in general, or plant life, or my lost love with whom I sat under it, or anything whatsoever. There is no intrinsic feature of the mental image in virtue of which it is about any given thing; if there were, Abelard notes, we could determine by inspection what a sign is about—but we can’t. Mental images, therefore, can’t explain the intentionality of understanding, because their role is merely instrumental. We think with them, and cannot avoid them; but they do not explain intentionality."

The structure Abelard offers is linguistic, a logic of mental acts: just as words can be said to express thoughts, so too we can use the articulated logic of language to give a theory of understanding. In short, Abelard gives something very like a linguistic account of mental representation or intentionality. To this end he embraces a principle of compositionality, holding that what an understanding is about is a function of what its constituent understandings are about. The unity of the understanding of a complex is a function of its logical simplicity, which is characterized by the presence of what Abelard calls “a single dominant conjunction” (the logical operator of greatest scope). Hence the understanding of a complex may be treated as a complex of distinct understandings, aggregated in the same thought, with its (logical) structure flowing from the ‘dominant conjunction’ over the other logical operations governing its constituent understandings. Abelard’s acts of attention thus display the logical structure of the understanding they express, and thereby give the semantics of written or spoken language. Much of Abelard’s writings on logic and dialectic are given over to working out the details as a scheme for explicating mental content."

Ethics,,42,abelard,"First published Tue Aug 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Aug 12, 2022"," Abelard takes the rational core of traditional Christian morality to be radically intentionalist, based on the following principle: the agent’s intention alone determines the moral worth of an action. His main argument against the moral relevance of consequences turns on what contemporary philosophers often refer to as moral luck. Suppose two men each have the money and the intention to establish shelters for the poor, but one is robbed before he can act whereas the second is able to carry out his intention. According to Abelard, to think that there is a moral difference between them is to hold that “the richer men were the better they could become … this is the height of insanity!” Deed-centred morality loses any kind of purchase on what might have been the case. Likewise, it cannot offer any ground for taking the epistemic status of the agent into account, although most people would admit that ignorance can morally exculpate an agent. Abelard makes the point with the following example: imagine the case of fraternal twins, brother and sister, who are separated at birth and each kept in complete ignorance of even the existence of the other; as adults they meet, fall in love, are legally married and have sexual intercourse. Technically this is incest, but Abelard finds no fault in either to lay blame."

Abelard takes an extreme case to make his point. He argues that the crucifiers of Christ were not evil in crucifying Jesus. (This example, and others like it, got Abelard into trouble with the authorities, and it isn’t hard to see why.) Their ignorance of Christ’s divine nature didn’t by itself make them evil; neither did their acting on their (false and mistaken) beliefs, in crucifying Christ. Their non-negligent ignorance removes blame from their actions. Indeed, Abelard argues that they would have sinned had they thought crucifying Christ was required and did not crucify Christ: regardless of the facts of the case, failing to abide by one’s conscience in moral action renders the agent blameworthy."

First, it is clear that we often want to perform the deed and at the same time do not want to suffer the punishment. A man wants to have sexual intercourse with a woman, but not to commit adultery; he would prefer it if she were unmarried. Second, it is clear that we sometimes “want what we by no means want to want”: our bodies react with pleasure and desire independently of our wills. If we act on such desires, then our action is done “of” will, as Abelard calls it, though not voluntarily. There is nothing evil in desire: there is only evil in acting on desire, and this is compatible with having contrary desires."

However, Abelard does not take ethical judgement to pose a problem. God is the only one with a right to pass judgement. Yet this fact doesn’t prevent us from enforcing canons of human justice, because, Abelard holds, human justice has primarily an exemplary and deterrent function. In fact, Abelard argues, it can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. He cites two cases. First, a woman accidentally smothers her baby while trying to keep it warm at night, and is overcome with grief. Abelard maintains that we should punish her for the beneficial example her punishment may have on others: it may make other poor mothers more careful not to accidentally smother their babies while trying to keep them warm. Second, a judge may have excellent (but legally impermissible) evidence that a witness is perjuring himself; since he cannot show that the witness is lying, the judge is forced to rule on the basis of the witness’s testimony that the accused, whom he believes to be innocent, is guilty. Human justice may with propriety ignore questions of intention. Since there is divine justice, ethical notions are not an idle wheel—nor should they be, even on Abelard’s understanding of human justice, since they are the means by which we determine which intentions to promote or discourage when we punish people as examples or in order to deter others."

This criterion can be discovered by reason alone, without any special revelation or religious belief, and is sufficient to ensure the rightness of the agent’s intention. But the resolution of this problem immediately leads to another problem.

In particular, he argues that the Afterlife is a condition to which we ought to aspire, that it is a moral improvement even on the life of virtue in this world, and that recognizing this is constitutive of wanting to do what God wants, that is, to live according to the Golden Rule, which guarantees as much as anything can (pending divine grace) our long-term postmortem happiness."

The Slave can follow the instructions or not. He reasons that if the Master indeed left the instructions, then by following them he will be rewarded and by not following them he will be severely punished, whereas if the Master did not leave the instructions he would not be punished for following them, though he might be lightly punished for not following them. (This conforms to the standard payoff matrix for Pascal’s Wager.) That is the position the Jew finds himself in: God has apparently demanded unconditional obedience to the Mosaic Law, the instructions left behind. The Philosopher argues that the Jew may have other choices of action and, in any event, that there are rational grounds for thinking that ethics is not a matter of action in conformity to law but a matter of the agent’s intentions, as we have seen above."

The Christian, however, reasons that the Afterlife is better, since in addition to the benefits conferred by living virtuously, the agent’s will is no longer impeded by circumstances. In the Afterlife we are no longer subject to the body, for instance, and hence are not bound by physical necessities such as food, shelter, clothing, and the like. The agent can therefore be as purely happy as life in accordance with virtue could permit, when no external circumstances could affect the agent’s actions. The Philosopher grants that the Afterlife so understood is a clear improvement even on the virtuous life in this world, and joins with the Christian in a cooperative endeavour to define the nature of the virtues and the Supreme Good.

Outlining his method in the Prologue to his Sic et non, Abelard describes how he initially raises a question, e.g. whether priests are required to be celibate, and then arranges citations from scriptural and patristic authorities that at least seem to answer the question directly into positive and negative responses. (Abelard offers advice in the Prologue for resolving the apparent contradictions among the authorities using a variety of techniques: see whether the words are used in the same sense on both sides; draw relevant distinctions to resolve the issue; look at the context of the citation; make sure that an author is speaking in his own voice rather than merely reporting or paraphrasing someone else’s position; and so on.) Now each authority Abelard cites seems to speak clearly and unambiguously either for a positive answer to a given question or for a negative one. If ever there were cases of plain meaning, Abelard seems to have found them in authorities, on opposing sides of controversial issues. His advice in the Prologue amounts to saying that sentences that seem to be perfect exemplars of plain meaning in fact have to be carefully scrutinized to see just what their meaning is. Yet that is just to say that they do not have plain meaning at all; we have to use reason to uncover their meaning. Hence the anti-dialecticians don’t have a case."

Real dialecticians, he maintains, reject (a)–(c), recognizing that human reason has limits, and that some important truths may lie outside those limits but not beyond belief; which claims about matters of faith we should accept depends on both the epistemic reliability of their sources (the authorities) and their consonance with reason to the extent they can be investigated."

The bulk of Abelard’s work on theology is devoted to his dialectical investigation of the Trinity. He elaborates an original theory of identity to address issues surrounding the Trinity, one that has wider applicability in metaphysics. The upshot of his enquiries is that belief in the Trinity is rationally justifiable since as far as reason can take us we find that the doctrine makes sense—at least, once the tools of dialectic have been properly employed."

Abelard accepts this account but finds it not sufficiently fine-grained to deal with the Trinity. The core of his theory of identity, as presented in his Theologia christiana, consists in four additional modes of identity: (1) essential sameness and difference; (2) numerical sameness and difference, which Abelard ties closely to essential sameness and difference, allowing a more fine-grained distinction than Boethius could allow; (3) sameness and difference in definition; (4) sameness and difference in property (in proprietate). Roughly, Abelard’s account of essential and numerical sameness is intended to improve upon the identity-conditions for things in the world given by the traditional account; his account of sameness in definition is meant to supply identity-conditions for the features of things; and his account of sameness in property opens up the possibility of there being different identity-conditions for a single thing having several distinct features."

The Morning Star is essentially the same as the Evening Star, for instance, since each is the selfsame planet Venus. Again, the formal elements that constitute a concrete thing are essentially the same as one another and essentially the same as the concrete thing of which they are the formal constituents: Socrates is his essence (Socrates is what it is to be Socrates). The corresponding general thesis does not hold for parts, however. Abelard maintains that the part is essentially different from the integral whole of which it is a part, reasoning that a given part is completely contained, along with other parts, in the whole, and so is less than the quantity of the whole."

The failure of numerical sameness may be due to one of two causes. First, objects are not numerically the same when one has a part that the other does not have, in which case the objects are essentially different as well. Second, objects are numerically different when neither has a part belonging to the other. Numerical difference thus entails the failure of numerical sameness, but not conversely: a part is not numerically the same as its whole, but it is not numerically different from its whole. Thus one thing is essentially different from another when either they have only a part in common, in which case they are not numerically the same; or they have no parts in common, in which case they are numerically different as well as not numerically the same. Since things may be neither numerically the same nor numerically different, the question “How many things are there?” is ill-formed as it stands and must be made more precise, a fact Abelard exploits in his discussion of the Trinity."

A cube of marble exemplifies both whiteness and hardness; what is white is essentially the same as what is hard, since they are numerically the same concrete thing, namely the marble cube; yet the whiteness and the hardness in the marble cube clearly differ in definition—but even so, what is white is characterized by hardness (the white thing is hard), and conversely what is hard is characterized by whiteness (the hard thing is white). The properties of whiteness and hardness are “mixed” since, despite their being different in definition, each applies to the selfsame concrete thing (namely the marble cube) as such and also as it is characterized by the other."

The matter out of which a form-matter composite is made is essentially the same as the composite, since each is the entire material composite itself. Yet despite their essential sameness, they are not identical; the matter is not the composite, nor conversely. The matter is not the composite, for the composite comes to be out of the matter, but the matter does not come to be out of itself. The composite is not the matter, since “nothing is in any way a constitutive part of or naturally prior to itself.” Instead, the matter is prior to the composite since it has the property priority with respect to the composite, whereas the composite is posterior to its matter since it has the property posteriority with respect to its matter. Now despite being essentially the same, the matter is not characterized by posteriority, unlike the composite, and the composite is not characterized by priority, unlike the matter.

Abelard deploys his theory of identity to shed light on the Trinity as follows. The three Persons are essentially the same as one another, since they are all the same concrete thing (namely God). They differ from one another in definition, since what it is to be the Father is not the same as what it is to be the Son or what it is to be the Holy Spirit. The three Persons are numerically different from one another, for otherwise they would not be three, but they are not numerically different from God: if they were there would be three gods, not one. Moreover, each Person has properties that uniquely apply to it—unbegotten to the Father, begotten to the Son, and proceeding to the Holy Spirit—as well as properties that are distinctive of it, such as power for the Father, wisdom for the Son, and goodness for the Holy Spirit. The unique properties are unmixed in Abelard’s technical sense, for the Persons differ from one another in their unique properties, and such properties do not apply to God; the distinctive properties are mixed, though, in that God is characterized by each (the powerful God is the wise God is the good God). Further than that, Abelard holds, human reason cannot go; but reason validates the analysis (strictly speaking only a “likeness” or analogy) as far as it can go."

Throughout the subsequent two centuries or so, doctrinal disputes arose between these two parties, resulting in the formation of various schools of thought (vāda; ācariyavāda) and teacher lineages (ācariyakula) (Vin 51–54; Mhv V 12–13.

The number eighteen, though, became conventional in Buddhist historiography for symbolic and mnemonic reasons (Obeyesekere 1991) and, in fact, different Buddhist sources preserve divergent lists of schools which sum up to more than eighteen. The likelihood is that the early formative period of the Buddhist community gave rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed spontaneously due to the geographical extension of the community over the entire Indian subcontinent and subject to the particular problems that confronted each monastic community (saṅgha). Each saṅgha tended to specialize in a specific branch of learning, had its own practical customs and relations with lay circles, and was influenced by the particular territories, economy, and use of language and dialect prevalent in its environment. Indeed, the names of the “eighteen schools” are indicative of their origins in characteristic doctrines, geographical locations, or the legacy of particular founders: for instance, Sarvāstivāda (“advocates of the doctrine that all things exist”), Sautrāntikas (“those who rely on the sūtras”)/Dārṣṭāntikas (“those who employ  examples”),[1]  and Pudgalavāda (“those who affirm the existence of the person”); Haimavatas (“those of the snowy mountains”); or Vātsīputrīyas (“those affiliated with Vātsīputra”) respectively. As noted by Gethin (1998, 52), rather than sects or denominations as in Christianity, “at least some of the schools mentioned by later Buddhist tradition are likely to have been informal schools of thought in the manner of ‘Cartesians,’ ‘British Empiricists,’ or ‘Kantians’ for the history of modern  philosophy.”[2]"

First, taking abhi in the sense of “with regard to,” abhidharma is understood as a discipline whose subject matter is the Dharma, the Buddha’s teachings. Second, using abhi in the sense of preponderance and distinction, abhidharma has also been deemed a distinct, higher teaching; the essence of the Buddha’s teachings or that which goes beyond what is given in the Buddha’s discourses, in a sense somewhat reminiscent of the term “metaphysics” (e.g., Dhs-a 2–3; Horner 1941; von Hinüber 1994). Buddhist tradition itself differentiates between the Sūtrānta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings by contrasting the Sūtrānta “way of putting things” in partial, figurative terms that require further clarification, versus the Abhidharma exposition and catechism that expound the teachings fully, in non-figurative terms (A IV 449–456; Dhs-a 154). This coincides with additional distinctions the tradition makes between texts that have implicit meaning (Skt., neyārtha, Pali, neyyattha) versus those that have explicit meaning (Skt., nītārtha, Pali nītattha) (A I 60; Ps I 18), and texts that are expressed in conventional terms (Skt., saṃvṛti, Pali, sammuti) versus others that are expressed in ultimate terms (Skt., paramārtha, Pali, paramattha) (Vibh 100–101; Mp I  94–97).[4]  From Abhidharma perspective, the sūtras were conveyed in conventional terms whose ultimate meaning required further interpretation."

This is evidenced in two characteristics of the genre that can be traced to earlier Buddhist literature. The first is the analytical style of the texts, which attempt to summarize meticulously the significant points of the Dharma and provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the mental and physical factors that constitute sentient experience. This analytical enterprise includes the arrangement of major parts of the material around detailed lists of factors and combinations of sets of their categories yielding matrices (Skt., mātṛkā, Pali, mātikā) of doctrinal topics. Already in the collections of the Buddha’s discourses, certain texts are arranged according to taxonomic lists, providing formulaic treatment of doctrinal items that are expounded elsewhere. Lists were clearly powerful mnemonic devices, and their prevalence in early Buddhist literature can be explained partly as a consequence of its being composed and for some centuries preserved  orally.[5]  For instance, one of the four primary Āgamas/Nikāyas, the collection of “grouped” sayings (saṃyukta/saṃyutta), groups the Buddha’s teachings according to specific topics, including the four noble truths, the four ways of establishing mindfulness, the five aggregates, the six sense faculties, the seven constituents of awakening, the noble eightfold path, the twelve links of dependent origination, and others. Similar taxonomic lists form the table of contents of the Vibhaṅga and Puggalapaññatti of the Theravāda and the Saṅgītiparyāya and Dharmaskandha of the Sarvāstivāda, which are structured as commentaries on those lists."

The texts seem to be the products of discussions about the doctrine within the early Buddhist community. Again, such discussions are already found in the Āgama/Nikāya collections (e.g., M I 292–305, III 202–257): they often begin with a doctrinal point to be clarified and proceed to expound the topic at stake using a pedagogical method of question and answer. The texts also record more formal methods of argumentation and refutation of rival theories that shed light on the evolution of the Abhidharma as responding to the demands of an increasingly polemical environment. The process of institutionalization undergone by Buddhist thought at the time and the spread of the Buddhist community across the Indian subcontinent coincided with a transition from oral to written methods of textual transmission and with the rise of monastic debates concerning the doctrine among the various Buddhist schools. Intellectual assimilation and doctrinal disputes also existed between the Buddhist monastic community and the contemporaneous Sanskrit Grammarians, Jains, and Brahmanical schools with their evolving scholastic and analytical movements, which must also have contributed to the Abdhidharma discursive hermeneutics and argumentative style. The dialectic format and the display of awareness of differences in doctrinal interpretation are the hallmarks of the Kathāvatthu and the Vijñānakāya. Later on, post-canonical Abhidharma texts became complex philosophical treatises employing sophisticated methods of argumentation and independent investigations that resulted in doctrinal conclusions quite far removed from their canonical antecedents."

All these modes of analysis provide descriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and mental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and conditions.

The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw subtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the differences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within this context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific mental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt., manovijñāṇa, Pali, manoviññāṇa) that is considered the central cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception. Mental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness, dharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid consciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in sequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with the five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory, etc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray dharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing  it.[6]"

This enterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception into their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their relations of causal conditioning.

It is important to remember, though, that the term dharma signifies both any category that represents a type of occurrence as well as any of its particular tokens or instances. The Theravāda introduced a system of eighty-two dhamma categories, meaning that there are eighty-two possible types of occurrence in the experiential world, not eighty-two occurrences. These are organized into a fourfold categorization. The first three categories include the bare phenomenon of consciousness (citta) that encompasses a single dhamma type and of which the essential characteristic is the cognizing of an object; associated mentality (cetasika) that encompasses fifty-two dhammas; and materiality or physical phenomena (rūpa) that include twenty-eight dhammas that make up all physical occurrences (Abhidh-av 1). All the eighty-one dhamma types in these three broad categories are conditioned (saṅkhata). Conditioned dhammas arise and cease subject to numerous causes and conditions and constitute sentient experience in all realms of the round of rebirth  (saṃsāra).[8]  The eighty-second dhamma that comprises the fourth category is unconditioned (asaṅkhata): it neither arises nor ceases through causal interaction.

Citta can never be experienced as bare consciousness in its own origination moment, for consciousness is always intentional, directed to a particular object that is cognized by means of certain mental factors. Citta, therefore, always occurs associated with its appropriate cetasikas or mental factors that perform diverse functions and that emerge and cease together with it, having the same object (either sensuous or mental) and grounded in the same sense faculty. Any given consciousness moment—also signified by the very term citta—is thus a unique assemblage of citta and its associated mental factors such as feeling, conceptualization, volition, or attention, to name several of those required in any thought process. Each assemblage is conscious of just one object, arises for a brief instant and then falls away, followed by another citta combination that picks up a different object by means of its particular associated mental factors."

It classifies these basic citta types most broadly according to their locus of occurrence, beginning with the sense-sphere (kāmāvacara) that includes forty-five citta types, most prominently those that concern the mechanics of perception of sensuous objects; next come eighteen form-sphere (rūpāvacara) consciousnesses that concern the mind that has attained meditative absorption (jhāna); followed by eight formless-sphere (arūpāvacara) consciousnesses that constitute the mind that has reached further meditative attainments known as formless states; finally, there are eighteen world-transcending (lokuttara) consciousnesses that constitute the mind at the moment of awakening itself: these have nirvana as their object. Within these four broad categories many other classifications operate. For instance, some dhammas are wholesome, others unwholesome; some are resultant, others are not; some are motivated, others are without motivations. These attribute matrices, writes Cox (2004A, 552), form “an abstract web of all possible conditions and characteristics exhibited by actually occurring dharmas. The individual character of any particular dharma can then be specified in accordance with every taxonomic possibility, resulting in a complete assessment of that dharma’s range of possible occurrences.”"

The Abhidharma lists of dharmas are “explicitly open” and reflect “a certain reluctance and hesitancy to say categorically that such and such is the definitive list of dharmas” (Gethin 2017, 252), leaving room for continued debates about what is and is not a dharma. For the Abhidharma, as for Buddhism in general, the limits of one’s world are set by the limits of one’s lived experience, and the causal foundation for lived experience is the operation of one’s cognitive apparatus. According to the Buddhist path, the nature of lived experience as based on one’s cognitive apparatus is to be contemplated by investigating the very nature of one’s mind through the practice of meditation. From this perspective, Abhidharma represents the theoretical counterpart to the practice of meditation. Within this context of Buddhist practice, dharmas are distinct (but interrelated) functions, energies, or causally significant aspects—in this sense “components”—of consciousness moments."

First, as “evaluative” analysis, the dharma typology maps out the constituents and workings of the mind and accounts for what makes up ordinary wholesome consciousness as opposed to the awakened mind. For instance, consciousness types that arise in a mind that has attained meditative absorption become increasingly refined and may never involve certain tendencies or defilements that might potentially occur in ordinary (even wholesome) consciousness. To watch dharmas as dharmas, writes Gethin (2004, 536), “involves watching how they arise and disappear, how the particular qualities that one wants to abandon can be abandoned, and how the particular qualities that one wants to develop can be developed. Watching dhammas in this way one begins to understand […] certain truths (sacca)—four to be exact—about these dhammas: their relation to suffering, its arising, its ceasing and the way to its ceasing. And in seeing these four truths one realizes the ultimate truth—dhamma—about the  world.”[9]"

Even the handful dharmas that are categorized as unconditioned (that is, having no cause and no effect) are shown to be not-self. The practice of the discrimination of dharmas thus undermines the apparently solid world we emotionally and intellectually grasp at that is replete with objects of desire and attachment. “Try to grasp the world of the Dhammasaṅgaṇi, or the Paṭṭhāna,” Gethin notes (1992B, 165), “and it runs through one’s fingers.”"

The category of the unconditioned within the dharma taxonomy also asserted the possibility of enduring or permanent dharmas, in contrast to all other dharmas that arise and cease through causal interaction. The Abhidharma exegesis, then, occasioned among Buddhist circles doctrinal controversies that could be termed ontological around such issues as what the nature of a dharma is; what, in the internal constitution of a dharma, makes it the very particular it is; the manner of existence of dharmas; the dynamics of their causal interaction; and the nature of the reality they constitute.

Albeit not a topic in its own right in the Buddha’s discourses, the doctrine of momentariness appears to have originated in conjunction with the principle of impermanence (Skt., anitya, Pali, anicca). This idea is basic to the Buddha’s empirically-oriented teaching about the nature of sentient experience: all physical and mental phenomena are in a constant process of conditioned construction and are interconnected, being dependently originated (e.g., A I 286; M I 230, 336, 500; S II 26, III 24–5, 96–9, IV 214). The Suttanta elaboration on these three interlocking ideas results in a formula (A I 152) that states that conditioned phenomena (Skt., saṃskārā, Pali, saṅkhārā) are of the nature of origination (uppāda), “change of what endures” (ṭhitassa aññathatta), and dissolution or cessation (vaya). This formula is known as the “three characteristics of what is conditioned” (tisaṅkhatalakkhaṇa). The Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika introduced four characteristics of conditioned phenomena: origination, endurance, decay, and dissolution. These are classified under the dharma category of “factors dissociated from thought.”"

The Sarvāstivādins use the term “moment” (kṣaṇa) in a highly technical sense as the smallest, definite unit of time that cannot be subdivided, the length of which came to be equated with the duration of mental events as the briefest conceivable entities. There is no Sarvāstivādin consensus on the length of a moment, but the texts indicate figures between 0.13 and 13 milliseconds in modern terms (Gethin 1998, 221; von Rospatt 1995, 94–110). This usage presupposes an atomistic conception of time, for time is not reckoned indefinitely divisible.

Atomic reality is understood as constantly changing: what appears to us as a world made up of enduring substances with changing qualities is, in fact, a series of moments that arise and perish in rapid succession. This process is not random, but operates in accordance with the specific capability and function of each atom. The spirit of this atomistic analysis of material reality applies equally to mental reality: consciousness is understood as a succession of discrete consciousness moments that arise and cease extremely  rapidly.[10]  Thus, the ratio of change between material and mental phenomena in any given moment is one to one: they occur in perfect synchronicity (Kim 1999, 54).

This induced a host of problems, one of which is that the Sarvāstivāda definition of a moment is difficult to reconcile with its conception as the shortest unit of time (von Rospatt 1995, 44–46 & 97–98). The Sarvāstivāda replies to this criticism by stating that the activities (kāritra) of the four characteristics of conditioned phenomena are sequential: the limits between the birth and dissolution of any event are referred to as one moment. This solution, however, implies that a single event undergoes four phases within a given moment, which inevitably infringes upon its momentariness (Cox 1995, 151; von Rospatt 1995, 52ff)."

They do not seem to have been as concerned as the Sarvāstivādins with the ontology and epistemology of material and mental realities per se. Rather, they were more preoccupied with the psychological apparatus governing the process of cognizing of sense data, and hence with the changing ratio between material and mental phenomena. The Yamaka of the canonical Abhidhamma offers what is probably the first textual occurrence of the term “moment” (khaṇa) in the sense of a very brief stretch of time that is divided into origination and cessation instants (Kim 1999, 60–61). Relying on the three characteristics of conditioned phenomena, the Pali commentaries later present a scheme wherein each moment of every phenomenon is subdivided into three different instants of origination (uppādakkhaṇa), endurance (ṭhitikkhaṇa) and cessation (bhaṅgakkhaṇa) (Spk II 266; Mp II 252). These are three phases of a single momentary phenomenon defined as one single dhamma or consciousness moment. A dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in the second, and ceases in the third (Karunadasa 2010, 234ff). The commentarial tradition thus analyzes phenomena temporally by dissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events that fall away as soon as they have originated in consciousness. As one event is exhausted, it conditions a new event of its kind that proceeds immediately afterwards. The result is an uninterrupted, flowing continuum (santāna) of causally connected momentary events. These succeed each other so fast that we conceive of the phenomena they constitute as temporally extended."

For example, cittakkhaṇa refers to the instant taken by one mental event. In this basic sense as denoting a very brief stretch of time, the term “moment” does not entail an atomistic conception of a definite and ultimate, smallest unit of time, but leaves open the possibility that time is infinitely divisible (von Rospatt 1995, 59–60 & 94–95). Here the three moments of origination, endurance, and cessation do not correspond to three different entities. Rather, they represent three phases of a single momentary phenomenon and are defined as one single consciousness moment: a dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in the second sub-moment and perishes in the third one. In this way, the Theravādins avoided some of the difficulties faced by the Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣikas, of how to compress the characteristics of the conditioned into one single indivisible moment and of how to account for their ontological status. The Theravādins also claimed that only mental phenomena are momentary, whereas material phenomena (e.g., common-sense objects) endure for a stretch of time. The Theravādin commentarial tradition subsequently elaborated on this proposition and produced a unique view of the ratio between material and mental phenomena, asserting that a material phenomenon lasts for sixteen or seventeen consciousness moments (Kv 620; Vibh-a 25–28; Vism XX 24–26; Kim 1999, 79–80 & §3.1)."

The equation of a moment with the duration of these transient events as extremely short occurrences—even the shortest conceivable—led to the direct determination of the moment in terms of these occurrences. Yet the doctrine of momentariness spawned a host of problems for the Buddhist schools, particularly with regard to the status of the endurance moment and to the explanation of continuity and conditioning interaction among the dharmas (see section 5 below). If dharmas go through an endurance phase or exist as real entities within the span of any given moment, how can they be momentary? And if experience is an array of strictly momentary dharmas, how can continuity and causal conditioning be possible?"

Nevertheless, the object of the doctrine of momentariness is not so much existence in time or the passage of time per se, but rather, in epistemological terms and a somewhat Bergsonian sense, the construction of temporal experience. Instead of a transcendental matrix of order imposed on natural events from without, time is seen as an inherent feature of the operation of dharmas. The doctrine of momentariness analyzes dharmas as they transpire through time: as psycho-physical events that arise and cease in consciousness and, by the dynamics of their rise and fall, construct time. The sequence of the three times is therefore secondary, generated in and by the process of conditioned and conditioning dharmas. In fact, the conceptual shift from the principle of impermanence to the theory of momentariness is a shift in time scales. While the Sūtrānta worldview interprets the three times as referring to past, present, and future lives, the Abhidharma sees them as phases that any conditioned dharma undergoes each and every moment. Impermanence marks dharmas over a period of time, but is also encapsulated in every single consciousness moment (Vibh-a 7–8; Sv 991; Vism XIV 191; Collins 1992, 227)."

A recurring idea in the exegetical Abhidharma literature from the period of the early vibhāṣā compendia onward is that dharmas are defined by virtue of their svabhāva. For instance, a definition transmitted in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya reads: “dharma means ‘upholding,’ [namely], upholding intrinsic nature (svabhāva),” and the Mahāvibhāṣā states that “intrinsic nature is able to uphold its own identity and not lose it […] as in the case of unconditioned dharmas that are able to uphold their own identity” (Cox 2004A, 558–559). Similarly, a definition prevalent in Theravādin Abhidhamma commentaries is: “dhammas are so called because they bear their intrinsic natures, or because they are borne by causal conditions” (e.g., Dhs-a 39-40; Paṭis-a I 18; Vism-mhṭ I 347). The commentaries also regularly equate dhammas with their intrinsic natures, using the terms dhamma and sabhāva interchangeably. For example, the Visuddhimagga proclaims that “dhamma means but intrinsic nature” (Vism VIII 246), and the sub-commentary to the Dhammasaṅgaṇi indicates that “there is no other thing called dhamma apart from the intrinsic nature borne by it” and that “the term sabhāva denotes the mere fact of being a dhamma” (Dhs-mṭ 28 & 94; see also Karunadasa 2010: Ch. 1)."

Adding that dharmas are borne by causal conditions counters the idea of intrinsic natures borne by underlying substances distinct from themselves. Just as dharmas are psycho-physical events that occur dependently on appropriate conditions and qualities, their intrinsic natures arise dependently on other conditions and qualities rather than on a substratum more real than they are (ibid; Karunadasa 1996, 13–16; Nyanaponika 1998, 40–41)."

Cox (2004A: 559–561) has shown that in the early period of northern Indian Abhidharma texts, as represented by the Śāriputrābhidharmaśāstra and portions of the Mahāvibhāṣā, the concept of intrinsic nature develops within the context of the method of inclusion (saṃgraha), that is, the process by which the inclusion of dharmas within a specific category is to be applied. Dharmas are determined (pariniṣpanna) by the intrinsic nature that defines them and hence should not be considered to possess a separately existing intrinsic nature. “‘Determination’ implies two further features of dharmas […] First, just as categories in a well-structured taxonomic schema are distinct and not subject to fluctuation, so also dharmas, as ‘determined,’ are clearly and unalterably discriminated: they are uniquely individualized and as such are not subject to confusion with other dharmas. [Second,] determination by intrinsic nature undergoes no variation or modification, and hence, dharmas, which are in effect types or categories of intrinsic nature, are established as stable and immutable” (ibid, 562). In the early Sarvāstivāda exegetical texts, then, svabhāva is used as an atemporal, invariable criterion determining what a dharma is, not necessarily that a dharma exists. The concern here is primarily with what makes categorial types of dharma unique, rather than with the ontological status of dharmas."
187,187,Abhidharma,4. Intrinsic nature: between categorization and ontology,,21,abhidharma,"First published Mon Aug 16, 2010; substantive revision Wed Jun 1, 2022"," Nevertheless, from the foregoing categorial theory, the mature Abhidharma drew ontological conclusions with regard to the reality of dharmas. This transition in the conception of dharma coincided with an inherent ambiguity in the term svabhāva, which is grounded logically and etymologically in the term bhāva that came to denote “mode of existence” (ibid, 565–568). In the vibhāṣā compendia and contemporaneous texts, “the explicit emphasis upon categorization per se recedes in importance as the focus shifts to clarifying the character and eventually the ontological status of individual dharmas. Accordingly, the term svabhāva acquires the dominant sense of ‘intrinsic nature’ specifying individual dharmas […] And determining individual dharmas through unique intrinsic nature also entails affirming their existence, as a natural function both of the etymological sense of the term svabhāva and of the role of dharmas as the fundamental constituents of experience. This then leads to the prominence of a new term that expressed this ontological focus: namely, dravya” (ibid, 569). Dravya means “real existence” and, within the Sarvāstivāda framework, dharmas that are determined by intrinsic nature exist as real entities (dravyatas), as opposed both to composite objects of ordinary experience that exist provisionally and to relative concepts or contingencies of time and place that exist relatively. The presence of intrinsic nature indicates that a dharma is a primary existent, irrespective of its temporal status, namely, whether it is a past, present or future dharma, and hence the Sarvāstivāda declaration that “all things exist.”"

But the Theravāda Abhidhamma shares with the Sarvāstivāda the same principles of dhamma analysis as a categorial theory that individuates sentient experience. Here, too, the taxonomic function of sabhāva gave rise to ontological connotations of existence in the characterization of dhammas. As the final units of Abhidhamma analysis, dhammas are reckoned the ultimate constituents of experience. “There is nothing else, whether a being, or an entity, or a man or a person,” a famous Pali commentarial excerpt proclaims (Dhs-a  155).[12]  While this statement is meant to refute the rival Pudgalavāda position of the reality of the person by insisting that there is no being or person apart from dhammas, there emerges the idea that the phenomenal world is, at bottom, a world of dhammas: that within the confines of sentient experience there is no other actuality apart from dhammas and that what constitutes any given dhamma as a discrete, individualized particular is its intrinsic nature. The Theravāda elaborates on the concept of sabhāva in juxtaposition to its theory of momentariness, and it acquires the sense of what underlies a dhamma’s endurance moment and as a point of reference to the moments of origination and cessation. Before a dhamma eventuates it does not yet obtain an intrinsic nature and when it ceases it is denuded of this intrinsic nature. As a present occurrence, though, while possessing its intrinsic nature, it exists as an ultimate reality and its intrinsic nature is evidence of its actual existence as such (Dhs-a 45; Vism VIII 234, XV 15). One commentarial passage even goes so far as naming this instant “the acquisition of a self” (Vism-mhṭ I 343)."

On the other hand, the systematic analysis of experience in terms of momentary dharmas required the Abhidharma to provide a rigorous account of the processes that govern psychological and physical continuity. What fuels these processes is causal interaction, but the very notion of causation is allegedly compromised by the theory of momentariness. If causes, conditions, and their results are all momentary events, how can an event that has ended have a result? How can an event that undergoes distinct stages of origination, endurance, and cessation in a brief moment have causal efficacy? Notwithstanding their doctrinal differences, both the Sarvāstivāda and the Theravāda Abhidhamma had to confront these challenges, and they did so by formulating complex theories of immediate contiguity that grant causal efficacy."

As documented in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (AKB 2.49) based on canonical texts including the Vijñānakāya, the Prakaraṇapāda, and the Jñānaprasthāna, the four conditions are: 1) root cause (literally “cause as condition,” hetupratyaya), reckoned the foremost in inciting the process of fruition and origination; 2) immediate antecedent, which holds between a consciousness moment and its immediately preceding moment in that consciousness series; 3) object support, which applies to all dharmas insofar as they are intentional objects of consciousness; and 4) predominance, which facilitates sensory discriminative awareness, e.g., the faculty of sight’s predominance over visual cognitive awareness. The six causes are: 1) instrumentality (kāraṇahetu), deemed the primary factor in the production of a result; 2) simultaneity or coexistence, which connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity, explaining the homogenous flow of dharmas that evokes the seeming continuity of phenomena; 4) association, which operates only between mental dharmas and explains why the elements of consciousness always appear as assemblages of mental factors; 5) dominance, which forms one’s habitual cognitive and behaviorist dispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the result of actively wholesome or unwholesome dharmas. The four conditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining phenomenal experience: for instance, each consciousness moment acts both as the homogenous cause as well as the immediate antecedent condition of the rise of consciousness and its concomitants in a subsequent  moment.[13]"

For the orthodox Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika, the existence of dharmas as real entities (dravyatas) is determined by both their intrinsic nature and particular causal functioning. Intrinsic nature, however, is an atemporal determinant of real existence. What determines a dharma’s spatio-temporal existence is its distinctive causal functioning: past and future dharmas have capability (sāmarthya) of functioning, while present dharmas also exert a distinctive activity (kāritra). Present activity is an internal causal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a dharma’s own consciousness series. It is this activity that determines a dharma’s present existence and defines the limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by contrast, is a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards another consciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists another dharma in the production of its own effect (Cox 2004A, 570–573; Williams 1981, 240–243). A dharma’s present activity arises and falls away, but past and future dharmas all have potential for causal functioning and exist as real entities due to their intrinsic nature. For the Sarvāstivāda, this model—which insists on constant change within the limits of the present moment and implies the existence of dharmas in the three time periods—preserves both the principle of impermanence yet explains continuity and causal efficacy."
192,192,Abhidharma,5. Causation: existence as functioning,,26,abhidharma,"First published Mon Aug 16, 2010; substantive revision Wed Jun 1, 2022"," The Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika distinction between a dharma’s activity and capability implies that each dharma or consciousness moment effects the next moment within its series, but it can also act as a contributory condition towards producing a different sort of effect. Activity engenders the next moment within a dharma’s series, while capability generates a different effect and explains the causal efficacy of past dharmas. Williams (1981, 246–247) helpfully notes that we may render this “horizontal” and “vertical” causality, within a consciousness series and transcending it respectively. For example, an instant of visual awareness horizontally produces the next moment of visual awareness and may or may not, depending on other factors such as light and so on, vertically produce vision of the object. “It follows that to be present is to have horizontal causality, which may or may not include vertical causality—a fact which serves to remind us that we are dealing here with primary existents which are frequently positioned within the system in terms of what they do” (ibid). Thus activity or horizontal causality—a dharma’s function of precipitating the next moment of its own consciousness series—individuates that dharma as a particular event of its kind. A dharma’s capability or vertical causality, by which it facilitates the occurrence of other dharmas outside its consciousness series, locates it within the web of interrelations that connects it with the incessant rise and fall of other dharmas, and hence further individuates it as that very particular dharma by manifesting its unique quality and intensity of operation."
193,193,Abhidharma,5. Causation: existence as functioning,,27,abhidharma,"First published Mon Aug 16, 2010; substantive revision Wed Jun 1, 2022"," The Saturāntika and the Theravāda developed alternative theories of causal conditioning in conjunction with their rejection of the Sarvāstivāda ontological model and their claim that dharmas exist only in the present. The Sautrāntika explained causal interaction among past and future dharmas by reference to the idea of “seeds” (bīja), or modifications in subsequent dharma series. The Sautrāntika theory of seeds is the precursor of two extremely important concepts of later Mahāyāna Buddhist thought, namely, the Yogācāra’s concepts of “store consciousness” (ālayavijñāna) and of Buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha) (Cox 1995, 94–95; Gethin 1998, 222). The Theravāda theory of causal conditioning, as set out in the Paṭṭhāna, proposes a set of twenty-four conditional relations (paccaya) that account for all possible ways in which a phenomenon may function in conditioning the rise of another phenomenon. The twenty-four conditional relations are: 1) root cause (hetupaccaya); 2) object support; 3) predominance; 4) proximity; 5) contiguity; 6) simultaneity; 7) reciprocity; 8) support; 9) decisive support; 10) pre-existence 11) post-existence; 12) habitual cultivation; 13) karma; 14) fruition; 15) nutriment; 16) controlling faculty; 17) jhāna – a relation specific to meditation attainments; 18) path – a relation specific to the stages on the Buddhist path; 19) association; 20) dissociation; 21) presence; 22) absence; 23) disappearance; 24)  non-disappearance.[15]  The majority of the Theravāda twenty-four conditions have counterparts in the Sarvāstivāda theory and both systems show various other parallel interests and points of resemblance. The likelihood, then, is that the two systems originated before the two schools separated and continued to evolve after their separation (Conze 1962, 152–153; Kalupahana 1961, 173)."

It turns out, then, that the relative positioning of each dharma within a network of causes and conditions is, first and foremost, a means for its individuation. Only in a subsidiary sense is this network an analysis of causal efficacy. What reappears here is the categorial dimension of the dharma analysis qua a metaphysical theory of mental events in terms of sameness of conditional relations. Analogous to the space-time coordinate system that enables one to identify and describe material objects, the network of conditional relations may be seen as a coordinate system that locates within it any given dharma, implying that to be a dharma is to be an event that has a place in that web of relations—an idea reminiscent of Donald Davidson’s principle of sameness of causes and effects as a condition of identity of events (2001 119–120 & 154–161). Two dharma instances of the same type would fit into the web of causal conditions in exactly the same way, but would then be distinguished as individual instances on the grounds of their unique degrees and modes of causal efficacy."

We have seen that the Abhidharma’s analysis of sentient experience reveals that what we perceive as a temporally extended, uninterrupted flow of phenomena is, in fact, a rapidly occurring sequence of causally connected consciousness moments or cittas (i.e., assemblages of citta and caitta/cetasika), each with its particular object. The mature Abhidharma thus assimilates the analysis of phenomena-in-time-as-constituted-by-consciousness with a highly complex description of the consciousness process, dissolving the causal relations between ordered successions of consciousness moments into the activity of perception. As previously noted in section 2, for the Abhidharma, as in Buddhist epistemology in general, sensory perception is the paradigm of perceptual, sentient experience. Like every instance of consciousness, sensory perception is intentional, encapsulated in the interaction among the sense faculties, their corresponding types of discriminative consciousness, and their appropriate sense objects. Different Buddhist schools, however, held different positions on the distinctive nature of perceptual experience, and on the specific roles of the sense faculties and status of sense objects in it. The Theravāda Abhidhamma and the Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika both espouse a view that proposes a direct contact between perceptual consciousness and its sense objects, the latter being understood as sensibilia, for what we perceive are not objects of common sense but their sensible qualities. We may characterize this view as phenomenalist realism (Dreyfus 1997, 331 & 336)."

Epistemology: Perception and the theory of the consciousness process,,30,abhidharma,"First published Mon Aug 16, 2010; substantive revision Wed Jun 1, 2022"," The Theravāda Abhidhamma sets out its theory of the consciousness process (citta-vīthi) in its commentaries and manuals, mainly in the works of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta (5th century CE), and Anuruddha (10th or 11th century CE), based on earlier descriptions in the Dhammasaṅgaṇi and the Paṭṭhāna (Vism XIV 111–124, XVII 126–145; Dhs-a 82–106 & 267–287; Vibh-a 155–160; Abhidh-s 17–21). The theory is not separate from the dhamma taxonomy and the analysis of citta as previously outlined in section 2. Rather, in congruency with the notion of existence (whether categorial or ontological) as functioning, it analyzes sensory perception as resulting from particular functions that are performed by the eighty-nine citta types revealed by the foregoing taxonomy. According to this analysis, the specific functions in the consciousness flow occur at particular instants of that continuum, as the normal flow of consciousness involves the mind picking up and putting down sense objects by means of successive sets of associated mental factors. The result is a fairly static account of mental and material phenomena as they arise in consciousness over a series of consciousness  moments.[16]"
197,197,Abhidharma,6. Epistemology: Perception and the theory of the consciousness process,,31,abhidharma,"First published Mon Aug 16, 2010; substantive revision Wed Jun 1, 2022"," Restricting the account to the consciousness process of ordinary beings, two types of process are described: five-sense-door processes (pañcadvāra) and mind-door processes (manodvāra). These may occur in succession, or mind-door processes may occur independently. Five-sense-door processes account for sensory perception as information is directly received from the fields of the five physical sense faculties. Mind-door processes internalize the information received through the sense faculties and characterize the mind that is absorbed in thought or memory. Objects at the “door” of the mind, which is treated in Buddhist thought as a sixth sense faculty, may be past, present, or future, purely conceptual or even transcendent. Normally, however, the object at the mind door will be either a past memory or a concept. If there is no perceptual activity, as is the case in deep, dreamless sleep, the mind is in a state of rest called inactive mode (bhavaṅga). Throughout one’s life, the same type of citta performs this function of the inactive mind that is the natural mode to which the mind reverts. The mind switches from its inactive mode to a simple mind-door process when a concept or memory occurs and no attention is directed to the other five sense fields. The simplest mind-door process is a succession of the following functions: 1) adverting to the object of thought: a function that lasts one moment and becomes internalized as an object support; 2) impulsion: occurs for up to seven moments and performs the function of the mind’s responding actively to the object with wholesome or unwholesome karma; 3) retaining: holding on to the object of the consciousness process for one or two moments."

This process of sensory perception involves a greater number of functions: 1) disturbed inactive mind: a function that arises due to the stimulus of the sense object. It lasts for two moments, during which sensory contact takes place, i.e., a physical impact of the sense object on the physical matter of the appropriate sense faculty; 2) adverting: lasts one moment, during which the mind turns towards the object at the appropriate sense “door;” 3) perceiving: lasts one moment and is the sheer perception of the sense object with minimal interpretation; 4) receiving: lasts one moment and performs the intermediary role of enabling transit to and from the appropriate discriminative consciousness, whether visual, auditory, etc.; 5) investigating: lasts one moment and performs the role of establishing the nature of the sense object and of determining the mind’s response to that object that has just been identified; 6) impulsion: same as in the mind-door process; 7) retaining: same as in the mind-door process. As an example, visual perception involves not only seeing itself, but also a succession of moments of fixing of the visual object in the mind, recognition of its general features, and identification of its nature. In both the mind-door and five-sense door processes, the sense faculty and its sense object condition the arising of a present moment of a corresponding apprehending consciousness, that is, perception here is modeled on simultaneous conditioning. And in both the mind-door and five-sense door processes, when the retaining function ceases, the mind reenters its inactive mode."

This means that the experience of the sense data presented to one’s mind is determined by one’s previous actions and is beyond of one’s immediate control. Whenever one remembers or conceptualizes, sees, hears, smells, tastes, or touches something that is desirable or pleasing, one experiences a result of previous wholesome consciousness. And vice versa with objects that are undesirable or unpleasing and previous unwholesome consciousness respectively. Only in the final stage of the consciousness process, when the mind has chosen to respond actively to its object in some way, actively present wholesome or unwholesome consciousness operates and constitutes karma that will bear future results. The Abhidhamma thus “provides an exact small-scale analysis of the process of dependent arising” (Gethin 1998, 216)."

The Sautrāntika theory of perception, however, is rather different. It rests on the Sautrāntika radical view of momentariness, according to which there is no real duration but only a succession of infinitesimal moments, and on its view of causation, according to which causes cease to exist when their effects come into existence. The application of these principles to sensory perception makes it difficult to explain how perception directly apprehends sense objects, for it implies that objects have ceased when their apprehending consciousness arises. The Sautrāntika reply is that consciousness does not have direct access to its sense objects. By contrast to phenomenalist realism, the Sautrāntika view of perceptual consciousness may be characterized as representationalism: it sees perception as apprehending its objects indirectly, through the mediation of aspects (ākāra) representative of their objects (Dreyfus 1997, 335 & 380–381)."

This shift was part of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical questions about the nature of the external world and the self, and focused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language. Their purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and means of valid cognition. Within Buddhist circles, this epistemological turn saw the rise of thinkers such as Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, the founders of the Yogācāra (400–480 CE), and, most notably, Dignāga and Dharmakīrti (around 500 CE) who developed sophisticated logical and philosophical systems (ibid, 15–19). The Abhidharma, then, sets the stage for this epistemological turn. The new emphasis becomes dominant from the period of the vibhāṣā compendia onward and is evident in a shift in the terminology used by the Abhidharma to describe the nature of dharmas. This terminological shift is indicated by the terms “particular inherent characteristic” (Skt., svalakṣaṇa, Pali, salakkhaṇa) and “general characteristic” (Skt., sāmānyalakṣaṇa, Pali, sāmānyalakkhaṇa)."

The Logicians use this term in the sense of “definition” of a concept or logical category. The Abhidharma applies it to the practice of the discernment of dharmas, distinguishing between multiple generic characteristics a dharma shares with other dharmas and (at least) one particular inherent characteristic that defines a dharma as that very individual occurrence distinct from any other instances of its type. The post-canonical Abhidharma thus assimilates the concept of the particular inherent characteristic with that of intrinsic nature. “Dhammas,” the Theravādin commentarial literature states, “are so called because they bear their particular inherent characteristics” (Vibh-a 45; Vibh-mṭ 35; Paṭis-a I 79; Vism XV 3), and a particular characteristic “is the intrinsic nature that is not held in common by other dhammas” (Vism-mhṭ II 137). Used in conjunction or interchangeably with intrinsic nature, the particular inherent characteristic constitutes a dhamma’s unique definition (Vism VI 19, 35). It is an epistemological and linguistic determinant of a dhamma as a knowable instance that is defined by a distinct verbal description."

The difference between the analytical description of dharmas in terms of their intrinsic nature or their characteristics, notes Cox (ibid, 576), is that “whereas intrinsic nature acquires its special significance in the context of exegetical categorization, the starting point for the characteristics lies in perspectivistic cognition. Ontology is a concern for both systems, but the shift in terminology from intrinsic nature to the characteristics reflects a concurrent shift from a category-based abstract ontology to an epistemological ontology that is experientially or cognitively determined.” This new epistemological emphasis looms in through a modified definition of existence proposed by the mature Sarvāstivāda exegesis that sees the causal efficacy underlying all existence as cognitive. Representing this development in the history of Sarvāstivāda thought is Saṅghabhadra (fifth century CE), who states in his Nyāyānusāra: “to be an object-field that produces cognition (buddhi) is the true characteristic of existence” (ibid). This means that dharmas as the constituents of our experiential world are objectively identifiable through cognition."

Yet the project also intends to ascertain that every constituent of the experiential world is knowable and nameable, and that the words and concepts used in the discourse that develops around the discernment of these constituents uniquely define their corresponding referents. The dharma analysis therefore paves the way for conceptual realism: a worldview that is based on the notion of truth as consisting in a correspondence between our concepts and statements, on the one hand, and the features of an independent, determinate reality, on the other hand. Conceptual realism does not necessarily have implications for the ontological status of this reality as externally existing. But to espouse such a position is to make a significant move away from the earliest Buddhist teaching that presents the Buddha’s view of language as  conventional.[17]"

Objects have dispositions and affordances — as a glass is disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid — but they do not have abilities.

Arguably both of these points about action apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is right, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in terms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and vague.

This is how to accommodate those powers of agents that appear to be especially closely connected to practical intelligence, such as skills and talents — which we might collectively call the intelligent powers. Are the intelligent powers simply a species of ability, or do they demand an independent treatment? There are a number of recent proposals to be considered here. (Robb forthcoming) proposes a dispositionalist theory of talent, on which a talent is a disposition to maintain and develop a skill. (McGeer 2018) emphasizes the significance of a distinctive kind of intelligent power, which she (following Ryle) calls an ‘intelligent capacity,’ and of which she too offers a broadly dispositionalist account. These proposals suggest a more general program of dispositionalism about the intelligent powers, which has suggestive parallels to the dispositionalism about ability that we will consider in Section 5.1. Still more generally, accurately accounting for the nature of the intelligent powers, and the relationship of these to abilities and to the powers more generally, remains an open and intriguing problem."

Alternatively, we may take this sort of point to militate in favor of a return to hypothetical theories of ability, since, at least on Lewis’s view of subjunctive conditionals, it may be that a disjunction follows from a counterfactual claim without either of its disjuncts following from that claim (Lewis 1973, 79–80).

If it is specific ability that matters, however, the challenge to (PAP) stands (see also Whittle 2010).

Vetter proposes that our basic modal notion should be potentiality. On a traditional view (which Vetter rejects) dispositions involve a dyadic relation between a stimulus and a manifestation (for example: a glass is disposed to break when struck). In contrast, potentials involve a monadic relation to a manifestation (for example: a glass has the potential to break). This makes potentials especially well-suited to give an account of abilities, which also appear to involve a monadic relation to an act, namely the act denoted by the complement of an ability-ascription (for example: I am able to play tennis). To have an ability, Vetter argues, is simply to have a certain kind of potentiality. Vetter also provides an explicit semantics for agentive modality in terms of the ascription of potentiality (Vetter 2013), which constitutes a systematic alternative to (MA)."

Steward argues that actions are exercises of two-way powers — ‘powers which an agent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all prior conditions at that moment fixed’ (Steward 2020, 345). These are to be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest whenever their manifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile glass breaks whenever it is struck. Unlike both the new dispositionalists on the one hand and Vetter on the other, Steward sees a fundamental asymmetry between agents, who are bearers of two-way powers, and mere objects, who are are bearers only of one-way powers. It is natural then to think that what it is to have an ability is to have a two-way power of a certain kind, and that a theory of ability should follow from an account of agency and the two-way powers."

Another approach, in a recent book-length treatment of ability (Jaster 2020), proposes that abilities should be thought of in terms of proportions of cases where an agent successfully does what she intends to do (compare the approach to dispositions advocated in Manley and Wasserman 2008). Both of these approaches are explicit in their denial of (CA), but they share — with the new dispositionalists — the thought that the analysis of ability should somehow appeal to a pattern of dependence between volition and action."

He argues that we should give an account of general ability in terms of specific abilities, which he calls ‘options’: roughly, an agent has the general ability to A iff she normally has A as an option.

His analysis, roughly, is that S has the ability to perform an action B just in case there is some basic action A such that (i) S’s doing A would cause or constitute S’s doing B and (ii) there is no obstacle to S’s doing A. The problem of giving a theory of ability then becomes the problem of giving a theory of obstacles, something at which Lewis, in his outline, makes a beginning.

(We should sharply distinguish this view, which we might call classical compatibilism, from more recent views such as the ‘semi-compatibilism’ of Fischer and Ravizza 1998).

That is not how I see it. The particular analysis of ability that a compatibilist presents is, as I see it, simply one of his premisses; his central premiss, in fact.

There is van Inwagen’s point just outlined, namely that arguments for the incompatibility of abilities and determinism are, inter alia, arguments against any theory of ability that is congenial to the compatibilist. And, finally, there is the point that we encountered in our discussion of the new dispositionalism in Section 5.1, which is that certain platitudes about ability — in particular, those involved in certain judgments about moral responsibility — may be recalcitrant to compatibilist treatments.

For precisely the reasons van Inwagen gives, it is doubtful that any theory of ability will suffice for a defense of ambitious compatibilism. There is another project, however, that the compatibilist might be engaging in. Let us say that, for some reason or other, she herself is not convinced by the incompatibilist’s argument. She is still left with an explanatory burden, namely to explain, if only to her own satisfaction, how it could be that abilities are compatible with the truth of determinism. Here the compatibilist’s aim is not to convince the incompatibilist of the error of her ways, but simply to work out a satisfactory conception of compatibilism. Let us call this modest compatibilism. This distinction is not often made, and it is not always clear which of these projects classical compatibilists are engaged in. If the latter project is indeed part of classical compatibilism, then we may grant many of the above points while still granting the theory of ability a central place in defenses of compatibilism.

For given the difficulties posed by abilities, and given the significance of theories of ability for areas of philosophy quite removed from the free will debates, there is something to be said for pursuing a theory of ability while embracing, if only temporarily, a certain quietism about the puzzles that determinism may pose."

During this time he was the head of a yeshiva (Jewish academy) in Burgos, but we do not know if this yeshiva was a public institution or just a private group of students that met in his home.

In my opinion, Abner’s argument for the Trinity and Incarnation is not based on Kabbalistic sources, but stems from his Neo-Platonic and standard Christian scriptural  background.[2]  Additionally, Abner (the apostate) did not use many important Kabbalistic  sources.[3]  His opinions are not the same as the other Rabbi Abner’s (the one that Rabbi Isaac of Acre quotes), and we can see that the two authors do not share the same background, nor do they use the same sources, with Abner utilizing almost entirely sources taken from the Jewish philosophical and traditional rabbinic  corpuses.[4]  almost all of Rabbi Abner’s sources are taken from the commentary of Nahmanides to the Torah, a book that Abner the apostate almost never quoted.

According to Abner, the Jews of the community, which is in North Castile, went outside the city to welcome the messiah, but instead of the messiah they received a rainfall of crosses that stuck to their clothes. Some of the Jews who witnessed the miracle went to Abner for advice. This event instilled in Abner some doubts about the question of the reason for the ongoing exile of Israel and the truth of Judaism. After twenty-two years of feeling ambivalent (i.e., around 1317) Abner wrote about his first revelation in a  dream.[5]  In his dream he saw a man that told him to be “a teacher of righteousness” (mostrador de justicia, not coincidentally the name of Abner’s main book) and to bring his people to freedom from exile. This dream just accents the uncertainty of the Jewish Rabbi. After three more years of studies he had a second dream wherein he had the same revelation, this time noticing that on the clothes the man wore were crosses like the cross of Jesus the Christian. This dream prompted him toward his final conversion around 1320/1321. After his conversion, Abner became the sacristan of the collegiate church of Valladolid and devoted himself to the propagation of Christianity amongst his former fellows Jews (he had come to the conclusion that conversion to Christianity was the only way to be saved from the Exile). We know he wrote an extended polemicist oeuvre and that he took part in the anti-Jewish polemic effort in North Castile around 1336–1339. There was a public disputation between Abner and a rabbi that occurred probably around 1335–1336 on the subject of the prayer of the Jews against the apostates. This dispute was the main reason for the decree against this part of the Jewish prayer (birkatha-minim) by Alfonso XI in 1336. Abner probably died in 1347 or later."

Here Abner distinguishes between the regular Jewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be saved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar). The latter are hopeless and are left with no religion, mostly due to their opinions that only the people who attain scientific knowledge have some kind of existence after death. Due to their feeling elevated over others, these philosophers have no hope of improving and accepting the truth of Christianity.

Abner had an original view on the Trinity. In his opinion, one can prove philosophically the reality of the  Trinity.[14]  He claimed that only the division of the divine source of the world can explain the diversity of the world. The infinite force of God (the father) would burn the finite matter of the world if it were not for some “transformer” that adapted the divine force to the finitude of matter (the son). Abner distinguished between two parts of the son. The superior son is part of the transcendent divinity. The inferior son is the divine essence in all the different parts of the world. The transformer of the divine force and essence is the superior son."

According to Abner, the essence of God is in the entire world. The world is composed only of corrupted matter and of divine essence in different degrees of purity. Even the most corrupted matter has inside itself some divine essence. The divine essence gives the corporeal form to matter and produces in it its dimensions. The uniqueness of a human being is the capacity to purify one’s matter, thereby reaching a higher degree of divine essence. According to Abner, what made Jesus unique was that he was born of the highest matter, enabling him to unite with the highest degree of divine essence that a human can attain. Abner thought that the superior son does not incarnate in this world. Jesus was only the highest degree of the inferior son that is present in the essences of the entire world."

The Trinity and Incarnation,,22,abner-burgos,"First published Mon Jul 9, 2012; substantive revision Fri Aug 28, 2020"," The opinion of Abner on Incarnation is closely related to his view of the doctrine of Original Sin. In Abner’s opinion, the reason for the original sin was Adam’s lack of comprehension. Adam thought that his intellect, which is an incarnation of divinity in people, was God, and he therefore wrongly concluded that he was God. In order to fix Adam’s error, humanity needed the Torah of Moses, which emphasized the unity of God in an exaggerated form and therefore explained (somewhat inaccurately) that God does not incarnate in the World at all. Only after this critical step, humanity was able to understand that, though there is divinity in humans, this divinity is not an independent God, but rather a part of the divine essence in the whole world. The Law of Moses that came to purify the world from idolatry has some problems. It does not enable the full emancipation of humanity from sin and error. Abner claimed that the negation of the incarnation of God in the world leads to negating the possibility of life after death. The possibility of life after death comes from understanding the incarnation of divinity in all humans. Negating life after death causes immorality. The Torah has to put up with all these inaccuracies in order to achieve its main goal, which is taking humanity out of the sin of idolatry (by believing that God is one). The outcome, though better than its predecessor, is ultimately a lost situation which humanity cannot overcome on its own. For that reason, God sent Jesus (who was born with a higher degree of matter and divine essence). Due to the divinity within Jesus, his miracles and his resurrection, people are able to understand that within everything in the world there is some divine essence that is part of the inferior son, and that the origin of all the divinity in the world is the superior son. This understanding enables salvation from the original sin and represents a true understanding of the relation between God and the world. The role of the sacramentental Mass is to remind us of the divine aspect of Jesus’ essence, as well as of all the miracles that Jesus performed and to continue their influence in our present time."
355,355,Abner of Burgos,3. The Trinity and Incarnation,,23,abner-burgos,"First published Mon Jul 9, 2012; substantive revision Fri Aug 28, 2020"," We see that this opinion regarding the Trinity and Incarnation contradict the official dogma of the Catholic Church at the time of Abner. In his opinion, the incarnation of divinity in Jesus did not bypass the regular process of the emanation of the divine essence in the world. Rather, the manifestation of Jesus represented the pinnacle of incarnation of divinity, which, though indeed present in the entire world, yet in Jesus occurred in the purest form possible. This opinion of Abner, similar to his other philosophical views, was a part of the radical Neo-Platonic interpretation of Christianity. The difference between him and the other Neo-Platonic Christian philosophers, like Master Eckard, is the different sources from which they were influenced. Abner did not utilize the traditional Neo-Platonic Christian sources, like Dionysius the Areopagite. We do not see in any part of his work that he was aware of the existence of these sources. On the other hand, Abner did utilize some Arabic and Jewish sources. The origin of his uncommon position on Christianity is found in his opposition to the common Aristotelian-Maimonidean-Averroist trend of Jewish philosophy. Abner, similar to Spinoza after him, thought that the explanations of these thinkers on the question of the creation of the world by a perfect God were not sufficient and ultimately inaccurate. In place of these responses, Abner proposed his radical interpretation of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, an interpretation that was uninfluenced by the theological Christian tradition. "
356,356,Abner of Burgos,4. Determinism,,24,abner-burgos,"First published Mon Jul 9, 2012; substantive revision Fri Aug 28, 2020"," One of the more important philosophical opinions of Abner was his deterministic  view.[15]  Abner devoted his book Ofrenda de Zelos (Minhat Kena’ot in the original lost Hebrew text), along with other works that have since been lost, to the question of determinism and free  will.[16]  In the beginning of this book, Abner describes the opinion of his former pupil Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, who denies God’s foreknowledge of human decisions. After the explication of this opinion and its negation, Abner explains his deterministic opinion. Abner believed that people have free will in a limited sense, but act in a determined way in the broader sense. People are free in their relation to themselves, meaning that if a person is separated from the causes that influence him or her (e.g., education, society’s influences) while debating between two options, one is then really free to choose either of the two options. In this specific case a person can then utilize his or her will and choose freely between the two options. However, if one takes into account all the causes that influence his or her will, we may conclude that these causes limits that person’s will to only one of the two options. In the opinion of Abner, people are like wax, as follows: Wax may be melted and sculpted into many different shapes. However, the person who sculpts the wax determines its present form as only one of those options. The same is true about people: In themselves, they have the ability to choose between different possibilities, but their relation to the outside world determines their choices. We can see from this example how strong the determinist view of Abner was. It is important to note that Abner defines the will of people as an accord between the attractive force and the imagination, two forces common to humans and animals."
357,357,Abner of Burgos,4. Determinism,,25,abner-burgos,"First published Mon Jul 9, 2012; substantive revision Fri Aug 28, 2020"," Abner explains in the same way the meaning of possibility and accident. Things are only possible in their relation to themselves. In relation to the entire world and its causality, everything is truly determined. Accidents are only accidents relative to the seeming unlikelihood of their occurrence. However, relative to all the causal processes of the world, we see that even in the most unusual of circumstances the occurrence of what appears to be an accident in fact had to happen. In short, there are no accidents (according to the popular meaning of accident) for Abner."

In the opinion of Abner free will does not really exist. For him, God is the first cause; He knows all the laws of the world and therefore knows everything that He has determined."
359,359,Abner of Burgos,4. Determinism,,27,abner-burgos,"First published Mon Jul 9, 2012; substantive revision Fri Aug 28, 2020"," This deterministic description leads to two theological problems. The first is why God sent commandments to people who cannot truly decide whether to obey them or disobey them. The second question that arises is how people can receive reward or punishment for actions and decisions that they do not really have any control over? Abner answers the second question by explaining that forbidden things are naturally bad. The punishment of the sinner is not a special act of divine providence; rather it is the natural consequence of his bad action. This leads us to the answer to the first question. According to Abner, the goal of the Torah is to influence people to do what is right. The Torah and prophets (and God who sent them) act in the world in conformity to His nature. The only way to influence someone to do something is to give him enough causes to do it. The Torah is only another cause that influences people to do what is good. Abner compares reward and punishment to a father that obligates his son to take medication. The medicine will always work even if the son takes it unhappily. The same is true with regard to all actions of people. When people do what is right, they believe they will receive a reward, while if they do what is wrong, they believe they will receive a punishment—even if they do not essentially have the choice to do anything else.

In fact, Abner is the first medieval Jewish philosopher to argue for a deterministic explanation of the world. His opinion influenced Rabbi Hasdai Crescas (who paraphrased an important part of Ofrenda de Zelos in his major philosophical work The Light of the  Lord[19]),  and through him, Spinoza. Some Jewish philosophers, like Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, Rabbi Mosses from Narbonne, and Rabbi Josef Ben Shem  Tov[20]  respond explicitly to the determinist opinion of Abner, such that there is no doubt that his opinion had a major influence on the internal Jewish debate on the question of free will throughout the 14th and 15th centuries.

Critics of the Aristotelian science,,30,abner-burgos,"First published Mon Jul 9, 2012; substantive revision Fri Aug 28, 2020"," The first interesting opinion of Abner is his view on prime matter. Abner denied a necessary link, which the Aristotelians affirmed, between bodies and accidents (magnitude, weight, quantity, etc.), maintaining that a body untainted by all these accidents can nonetheless have actual existence. He explicated his view in the dogmatic context of the question of the rite of  Mass.[22]  The rebel’s main philosophical arguments against the Mass are as follows: (1) How can several bodies occupy the same place? (2) How can Jesus’ body be in the bread and wine without changing them? (3) How can the same body be two different materials at the same time? (4) How can one debase Jesus by eating and digesting him? At the start of his answer Abner emphasizes that the Mass is miraculous. Nevertheless, he does go on to offer a scientific explanation of transubstantiation. For Abner, everybody has a layer of pure divine existence, to which are superadded other forms and accidents; but if the body is stripped of all of these accretions it will be reduced to the original divine substance only. In this state the body will have no boundary, quantity, or weight to occupy the universe, and consequently is infinite. This body is the foundation of the entire material world, and normally—with the exception of the sacrament of the Mass and Incarnation—it does not exist without accidents (at least not in the sublunary world). This matter is identified with the flesh of Jesus, which has divine existence only, which means that Jesus’ body is identified with prime matter."

The problem of the co-presence of two bodies in one place is eliminated, because all bodies, once they have been stripped of their form and accidents, incorporate the infinite body of Jesus, which fills the entire universe. After these forms have been removed, the bread and wine are identified with Jesus’ body. The very same principle eliminates the problem of the simultaneous existence of Jesus’ body in several places, since his body fills the entire universe and transcends all definitions of place. Because his body also transcends the definition of quantity, the problem of limited quantity is removed as well."

In the thought of Aristotle, the definition of place is ‘the limit of the encompassing body’. In his opinion, place has an important role in movement. The definition of a natural movement is the movement of a body to its natural place in the world. Aristotle explains that both the natural place attracts the body and that the body moves on his own to its natural place."

Critics of the Aristotelian science,,33,abner-burgos,"First published Mon Jul 9, 2012; substantive revision Fri Aug 28, 2020"," Abner distinguishes between the physical object and extension or dimension. According to Abner, dimension is “a simple and subtle quantity detached from all movable bodies”; in other words, it is space, independent of any physical body. Dimension is measurable per se, and is not linked to what occupies it. Nevertheless, Abner’s definition of place is still associated with body: “place” is the dimension occupied by a body, and it is the body that turns it into “place.” According to Abner, the movement of bodies is not due to their being attracted to some place where they must rest before resuming their movement; rather, they move because of the interaction of several forces, quite independent of any particular place. A body that is thrown upward rises, but if it suddenly begins to fall because of an opposing force, there would not be a moment of rest between the two opposing motions."

Abner influenced with his polemical works the Jewish-Christian debate until the end of the Middle Ages. Some born-Christians, like Alfonso de Espina, and especially Jewish apostates, like Pablo de Santa Maria, utilized his polemical works. Against this trend, there are more than five Jewish polemicist works that explicitly answer the polemical arguments of  Abner.[23]  Despite the utilization of Abner in debates, his works had almost no philosophical influence on Christian theology because the Christian participants in the debates utilized the quotations of the Jewish sources by Abner and not his theological arguments as such, which in their content were very different from the official Catholic dogma."
371,371,Abner of Burgos,6. The influence of Abner,,39,abner-burgos,"First published Mon Jul 9, 2012; substantive revision Fri Aug 28, 2020"," The second way in which Abner had lasting influence was on the purely philosophical plane. It should be noted that the direct philosophical influence of Abner was only on the Jewish community. In fact we do not see that any Christian philosophers read the works of Jewish apostates in any other forum apart from the purely polemical one. By contrast, in the Jewish community the works of Abner had an important impact until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. The deterministic opinion of Abner is with no doubt one of the major causes to the extensive number of works written on this subject in the 14th and 15th centuries by Jewish philosophers. For the most part, these works were against the opinion of Abner. The most impressive philosophical influence of Abner was on Rabbi Hasdai Crescas (died in 1410/1411). Crescas was the main Jewish philosopher during the end of the Middle Ages. Despite their opposite positions in the Jewish-Christian debate (Crescas wrote one of the more philosophical anti-Christian  works),[24]  Crescas borrowed some of the major original philosophical opinions of Abner, including determinism, the difference between the attributes of the essence and the attributes that are essential, and the criticism of Aristotelian science. With regard to this entire subject, Crescas molded his opinion using Abner combined with other sources. In spite of this important change, we can clearly see signs of the philosophy of Abner in the writing of Crescas, and these signs constitute nearly all the post medieval influence of Abner on Jewish and general Western philosophy.

One group envisages a synthesis between Jewish culture on the one hand, and the ideals of the Renaissance on the  other.[2]   Jews, according to this interpretation, could quite easily remain Jewish while still sharing in the values and culture of non-Jewish society. Another group, however, maintains that such a synthesis is historically untenable because Jews remained a small, persecuted minority left to the whims of various local  governments.[3]   These two approaches leave us with radically different conceptions of Renaissance Jewish philosophers. According to the first approach, a Jewish intellectual could quite easily partake of the ideals and categories of Renaissance Humanism and Neoplatonism. According to the second approach, however, such a synthesis could never occur, and, as a result, most Renaissance Jewish thinkers were more indebted to the legacy of Maimonides than the various trajectories of Renaissance thought. A more productive approach, however, exists between these two: The Italian Renaissance provided certain elite Jews with new literary genres, intellectual categories, and educational ideals with which to mine the depths of their tradition."

This became especially pronounced in post-Maimonidean philosophy, which witnessed the radicalization of a number of principles (e.g., eternality of the universe, denial of bodily resurrection), and which threatened to undermine traditional religious belief. This led to a Kulturkampf between those who thought that non-Jewish learning (i.e., philosophy) had a valid role to play in the Jewish curriculum versus those who claimed that such “foreign” works led to apostasy.

Yet, in the thought of Judah this “conflict” between the hitherto venerable antagonists virtually disappears. The question we have to ask, then, is why?  The most likely reason is to be located in the notion of sophia perennis, which played an important role in the thought of Florentine humanists. According to this doctrine, there exists a unity to all knowledge irrespective of its source.  As a result, the rationalism of philosophy could quite easily be reconciled with that of revelation because both were regarded as articulating the same truth. Evidence of this may be seen in Judah’s frequent citation of biblical passages to support philosophical principles and vice versa. Furthermore, because Judah is primarily unconcerned with the antagonism between faith and reason, he becomes one of the first Jewish philosophers to ignore esotericism (viz., that philosophical truths must be kept from the unenlightened) as a philosophical principle. For him, traditional esoteric topics, such as metaphysics, now become part and parcel of the beautiful and dramatic unfolding of God’s beauty in the universe, and such topics are open to all (including women, as the character of Sophia demonstrates)."

Yet, on a deeper level he wants to argue that the Greeks ultimately derived their teachings from the ancient Israelites and subsequently corrupted  them.[15]  For instance, Judah argues that Plato studied among the ancient Israelites in  Egypt,[16]  and that Plato’s myth of the Androgyne, found in the Symposium, is actually a Greek plagiarism of a Jewish source:"

This grace exists in objects of sight by reason of their spiritual nature, and it is the custom to enter through the clear and spiritual eyes, to delight our soul and move it to a love of such an object; and this is what it is that we call beauty. It is also found in objects of hearing, such as beautiful oratory, voices, speech, song music, consonance, proportion and harmony.

In the Renaissance, however, eloquence was equated with wisdom, and the good rhetorician had to be proficient in all branches of human knowledge. This led many Jewish Renaissance thinkers to examine not only the classical authors (e.g., Cicero and Quintilian), but also to mine the Bible for its use of language and style. Whereas Maimonides and other Jewish Aristotelians had been interested in biblical rhetoric as a means to reproduce imaginative representations of philosophical truths to those unlearned in philosophy, Renaissance thinkers held that rhetoric was the art form par excellence, one that enabled the individual to command respect in public  life.[23]"

At stake in these debates was God’s omnipotence and omniscience: If the world was created, then clearly God is transcendent to the world as both its Creator and Sustainer; if not, then God’s power to act is potentially curtailed by another principle’s eternality.

This theory of emanation, based on the love of  beauty,[26]  pervades the entire universe (both supra- and sub-lunar). The Active Intellect, the lowest of the ten heavenly intellects and associated with the sphere of the moon, becomes the intellect of the corporeal world. By contemplating its own beauty it produces the forms found in this world, and in contemplating the beauty of its cause, it produces human intellects. Following this, Judah offers a Plotinian account based on a celestial  triad.[27]   He now distinguishes between three types of beauty that pervade the cosmos. The first is God qua the Source of beauty (l’attore di bellezza), the second is beauty itself (bellezza; i.e., intelligible beauty), and the third is the physical universe produced by this idea in the intellect of God (il participante di  bellezza).[28]"

Since this physical world is intimately connected to God, it cannot be negated. Rather, this world becomes necessary, and this is a leitmotiv that runs throughout the work, for humans to make physical beauty “spiritual in our  intellect.”[30]   One must, in other words, orientate oneself towards sensible beauty in such a manner that one reverses the ontological chain."

Hearing, intimately connected to the Renaissance ideal of rhetoric, consists of the ability to discern “fine speeches, excellent reasoning, beautiful verses, sweet music, and beautiful and harmonious  melodies.”[32]   Sight, ranked just above the faculty of hearing, owing to the primacy that Judah puts on vision, deals with “beautiful colors, regular patterns, and light in all its varied  splendor.”[33]   The senses, thus, function hierarchically as a prolegomenon to any form of higher knowledge, with the imagination forming the threshold (mezzo) between the senses and the intellect."

It is light, then, that enables us to “comprehend all the beautiful shining objects of the corporeal  world.”[36]  Sight becomes the model by which we engage the universe: it is what makes knowledge possible since it is only through vision of tangible particulars that we acquire knowledge of intelligibles."

Judah does admit, though, that some special individuals are able to unite with the angelic world, which he describes as the Agent Intellect (intelleto agente).  When such unification (copulare) occurs, the individual “sees and desires divine beauty as in a crystal or a clear mirror, but not directly” (vede e desia la bellezza divine come in uno mezzo cristiallino, o sia chiaro specchio, ma non in se stessa  immediate).[38]   Judah refers to this act as prophecy.

For Judah, “it is this adulterous love that beautifies the lower world with such wondrous variety of the fair-formed  things.”[59]   In keeping with Judah’s claim that “the lower can be found in the  higher,”[60]  this world becomes one gigantic mirror that reflects spiritual beauty, and in which one can grasp divine  intelligibles.[61]   Just as Philo is enthralled by Sophia’s beauty, the individual, upon contemplating physical objects that are beautiful, apprehends the divine:"

Ashkenazi, in a letter to Don Isaac Abrabanel, criticizes Judah for his lack of philosophical esotericism, and for spending too much time on linguistic matters, such as riddles and eloquence. Such antagonism reflects the broader context of the Maimonidean controversies, in which philosophers sought to make philosophy known to a broader Jewish public often by means of dramatic dialogues or philosophical novels. Those opposed to the Aristotelian-Maimonidean paradigm of philosophy often blamed such treatises for weakening the faith of Jews by diminishing their commitment to the halakhah (law) and, thus, making them more susceptible to conversion.   Despite such initial criticisms, however, subsequent generations stressed the interrelationship between Platonism and kabbalah on the one hand, and philosophy and aesthetics on the other.

This led him to conceive of the universe as a living, dynamic structure, in which all levels share in a symbiotic and organic relationship. Unlike many of his medieval predecessors, he did not define this world, the world of form and matter, in terms of privation or its distance from the divine. On the contrary, he envisages this world as the arena wherein individuals encounter, through sensual particulars, the beauty and love of the divine.   Abrabanel’s emphasis, like that of many of his Renaissance contemporaries, on aesthetics and the phenomenal world would eventually become an important dimension of 16th- and 17th -century natural philosophy.

It is widely agreed that the ontological distinction is of fundamental importance, but as yet, there is no standard account of how it should be drawn. There is a consensus about how to classify certain paradigm cases. For example, it is usually acknowledged that numbers and the other objects of pure mathematics, like pure sets, are abstract (if they exist), whereas rocks, trees, and human beings are concrete. In everyday language, it is common to use expressions that refer to concrete entities as well as those that apparently refer to abstractions such as democracy, happiness, motherhood, etc. Moreover, formulations of mathematical theories seem to appeal directly to abstract entities, and the use of mathematical expressions in the empirical sciences seems indispensable to the formulation of our best empirical theories (see Quine 1948; Putnam 1971; and the entry on  indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics).

Yet there may be many equally interesting ways of accomplishing these two goals, and if we find ourselves with two or more accounts that do the job rather well, there may be no point in asking which corresponds to the real abstract/concrete distinction. This illustrates a general point: when technical terminology is introduced in philosophy by means of examples, but without explicit definition or theoretical elaboration, the resulting vocabulary is often vague or indeterminate in reference. In such cases, it usually is pointless to seek a single correct account. A philosopher may find herself asking questions like, ‘What is idealism?’ or ‘What is a substance?’ and treating these questions as difficult questions about the underlying nature of a certain determinate philosophical category. A better approach may be to recognize that in many cases of this sort, we simply have not made up our minds about how the term is to be understood, and that what we seek is not a precise account of what this term already means, but rather a proposal for how it might fruitfully be used for philosophical analysis.

Frege reduced properties and relations to functions and so these entities are not included among the objects. Some authors make use of Frege’s notion of ‘object’ when discussing abstract objects (e.g., Hale 1987). But though Frege’s sense of ‘object’ is important, it is not the only way to use the term. Other philosophers include properties and relations among the abstract objects. And when the background context for discussing objects is type theory, properties and relations of higher type (e.g., properties of properties, and properties of relations) may be all be considered ‘objects’. This latter use of ‘object’ is interchangeable with  ‘entity.’[1]  Throughout this entry, we will follow this last usage and treat the expressions ‘object’ and ‘entity’ as having the same meaning.

Historical Remarks,2.1 The Provenance of the Distinction,0,abstract-objects,"First published Thu Jul 19, 2001; substantive revision Mon Aug 9, 2021"," The contemporary distinction between abstract and concrete is not an ancient one. Indeed, there is a strong case for the view that, despite occasional exceptions, it played no significant role in philosophy before the 20th century. The modern distinction bears some resemblance to Plato’s distinction between Forms and Sensibles. But Plato’s Forms were supposed to be causes par excellence, whereas abstract objects are generally supposed to be causally inert. The original ‘abstract’/‘concrete’ distinction was a distinction among words or terms. Traditional grammar distinguishes the abstract noun ‘whiteness’ from the concrete noun ‘white’ without implying that this linguistic contrast corresponds to a metaphysical distinction in what these words stand for. In the 17th century, this grammatical distinction was transposed to the domain of ideas. Locke speaks of the general idea of a triangle which is “neither Oblique nor Rectangle, neither Equilateral, Equicrural nor Scalenon [Scalene]; but all and none of these at once,” remarking that even this idea is not among the most “abstract, comprehensive and difficult” (Essay, IV.vii.9). Locke’s conception of an abstract idea as one that is formed from concrete ideas by the omission of distinguishing detail was immediately rejected by Berkeley and then by Hume. But even for Locke there was no suggestion that the distinction between abstract ideas and concrete or particular ideas corresponds to a distinction among objects. “It is plain, …” Locke writes, “that General and Universal, belong not to the real existence of things; but are Inventions and Creatures of the Understanding, made by it for its own use, and concern only signs, whether Words or Ideas” (III.iii.11)."

So conceived, the distinction becomes a central focus for philosophical discussion primarily in the 20th century. The origins of this development are obscure, but one crucial factor appears to have been the breakdown of the allegedly exhaustive distinction between mental and material objects, which had formed the main division for ontologically-minded philosophers since Descartes. One signal event in this development is Frege’s insistence that the objectivity and aprioricity of the truths of mathematics entail that numbers are neither material beings nor ideas in the mind. If numbers were material things (or properties of material things), the laws of arithmetic would have the status of empirical generalizations. If numbers were ideas in the mind, then the same difficulty would arise, as would countless others. (Whose mind contains the number 17? Is there one 17 in your mind and another in mine? In that case, the appearance of a common mathematical subject matter would be an illusion.) In The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884), Frege concludes that numbers are neither external concrete things nor mental entities of any sort."

Frege does not say that senses are abstract. He says that they belong to a third realm distinct both from the sensible external world and from the internal world of consciousness. Similar claims had been made by Bolzano (1837), and later by Brentano (1874) and his pupils, including Meinong and Husserl. The common theme in these developments is the felt need in semantics and psychology, as well as in mathematics, for a class of objective (i.e., non-mental) non-physical entities. As this new realism was absorbed into English-speaking philosophy, the traditional term ‘abstract’ was enlisted to apply to the denizens of this third realm. In this vein, Popper (1968) spoke of the ‘third world’ of abstract, objective entities, in the broader sense that includes cultural products such as arguments, theories, and works of art."

These terms stood for positions that have little to do with the modern notion of an abstract object. Modern platonists (with a small ‘p’) need not accept any of the distinctive metaphysical and epistemological doctrines of Plato, just as modern nominalists need not accept the distinctive doctrines of the medieval nominalists. Moreover, the literature also contains mention of anti-platonists, many of whom see themselves as fictionalists about abstracta, though this doesn’t help if it turns out that the best analysis of fictions is to regard them as abstract objects. So the reader should therefore be aware that terminology is not always well-chosen and that the terms so used sometimes stand for doctrines that are more restricted than the traditional doctrines that go by the same name. Henceforth, we simply use platonism for the thesis that there exists at least one abstract object, and nominalism for the thesis that the number of abstract objects is exactly zero (Field 1980)."

In this section we briefly survey the arguments for nominalism and the responses that platonists have offered. If the abstract objects are unified as a class, it is because they have some feature that generates what seems to be a distinctive problem—a problem that nominalists deem unsolvable and which platonists aim to solve.

Others have taken on the somewhat less daunting task of accepting (i) but rejecting (ii) and (iii); they’ve argued that even if our best scientific theories, in regimented form, quantify over mathematical entities, this doesn’t entail a commitment to mathematical entities (see Azzouni 1997a, 1997b, 2004; Balaguer 1996, 1998; Maddy 1995, 1997; Melia 2000, 2002; Yablo 1998, 2002, 2005, 2009; Leng 2010.)

This latter question has been the subject of a debate that began in earnest in Benacerraf (1973), which posed just such a dilemma for mathematical objects. Benacerraf noted that the causal theory of reference doesn’t seem to make it possible to know the truth conditions of mathematical statements, and his argument applies to abstract entities more generally. On the other hand, nominalists need to explain the linguistic uses in which we seem to appeal to such entities, especially those uses in what appear to be good explanations, such as those in scientific, mathematical, linguistic, and philosophical pursuits (see Wetzel 2009, 1–22, for a discussion of the many places where abstract types are used in scientific explanations).

Maddy (1990, 1997) developed two rather different ways of understanding our knowledge of mathematics in naturalistic ways.

Balaguer (1995, 1998) also suggests that a plenitude principle is the best way forward for the platonist, and that our knowledge of the consistency of mathematical theories suffices for knowledge of mathematical objects.

These proposals sometimes suggest that statements about abstract objects are merely instrumental; they serve only to help us establish conclusions about concrete objects. Field’s fictionalism (1980, 1989) has been influential in this regard. Field reconstructed Newtonian physics using second-order logic and quantification over (concrete) regions of space-time. A completely different tactic for avoiding the commitment to abstract, mathematical objects is put forward in Putnam (1967) and Hellman (1989), who separately reconstructed various mathematical theories in second-order modal logic. On their view, abstract objects aren’t in the range of the existential quantifier at the actual world (hence, we can’t say that they exist), but they do occur in the range of the quantifier at other possible worlds, where the axioms of the mathematical theory in question are true."

These views don’t reject an external material world, but rather begin with some question as to whether we can have experience, observation, and knowledge of objects directly, i.e., independent of our theoretical frameworks. Carnap (1950 [1956]), for example, started with the idea that our scientific knowledge has to be expressed with respect to a linguistic framework and that when we wish to put forward a theory about a new kind of entity, we must have a linguistic framework for talking about those entities. He then distinguished two kinds of existence questions: internal questions within the framework about the existence of the new entities and external questions about the reality of the framework itself. If the framework deals with abstract entities such as numbers, sets, propositions, etc., then the internal question can be answered by logical analysis of the rules of the language, such as whether it includes terms for, or implies claims that quantify over, abstract objects. But, for Carnap, the external question, about whether the abstract entities really exist, is a pseudo-question and should be regarded as nothing more than the pragmatic question of whether the framework is a useful one to adopt, for scientific or other forms of enquiry. We’ll discuss Carnap’s view in more detail in  subsection 3.7.1."

However, there are deflationist proposals that run counter to Carnap’s approach, among them, deflationary nominalism (Azzouni 2010) or agnosticism about abstract objects (Bueno 2008a, 2008b, 2020).

A final agnostic position that has emerged is one that rejects a strict version of platonism, but suggests that neither a careful analysis of mathematical practice (Maddy 2011), nor the enhanced version of the indispensability argument (Leng 2020) suffice to decide between nominalism and moderate versions of platonism. Along these lines, Balaguer (1998) concluded that the question doesn’t have an answer, since the arguments for ‘full-blooded’ platonism can be matched one-for-one by equally good arguments by the anti-platonist."

Thus, one might take abstract and concrete as primitive notions.

For example, if one is given a range of white things of varying shapes and sizes; one ignores or abstracts from the respects in which they differ, and thereby attains the abstract idea of whiteness. Nothing in this tradition requires that ideas formed in this way represent or correspond to a distinctive kind of object. But it might be maintained that the distinction between abstract and concrete objects should be explained by reference to the psychological process of abstraction or something like it. The simplest version of this strategy would be to say that an object is abstract if it is (or might be) the referent of an abstract idea; i.e., an idea formed by abstraction.

Dedekind suggested that when defining a number-theoretic structure, “we entirely neglect the special character of the elements, merely retaining their distinguishability and taking into account only the relations to one another” (Dedekind 1888 [1963, 68]). This view has led some structuralists to deny that numbers are abstract objects. For example, Benacerraf concluded that “numbers are not objects at all, because in giving the properties (that is, necessary and sufficient) of numbers you merely characterize an abstract structure—and the distinction lies in the fact that the ‘elements’ of the structure have no properties other than those relating them to other ‘elements’ of the same structure” (1965, 70).

But this entails that tables and chairs are mind-dependent, and that is not what philosophers who employ this notion have in mind. To call an object ‘mind-dependent’ in a metaphysical context is to suggest that it somehow owes its existence to mental activity, but not in the boring ‘causal’ sense in which ordinary artifacts owe their existence to the mind. What can this mean? One promising approach is to say that an object should be reckoned mind-dependent when, by its very nature, it exists at a time if and only if it is the object or content of some mental state or process at that time. This counts tables and chairs as mind-independent, since they might survive the annihilation of thinking things. But it counts paradigmatically mental items, like a purple afterimage of which a person \(X\) may become aware, as mind-dependent, since it presumably lies in the nature of such items to be objects of conscious awareness whenever they exist. However, it is not clear that this account captures the full force of the intended notion. Consider, for example, the mereological fusion of \(X\)’s afterimage and \(Y\)’s headache. This is surely a mental entity if anything is. But it is not necessarily the object of a mental state. (The fusion can exist even if no one is thinking about it.) A more generous conception would allow for mind-dependent objects that exist at a time in virtue of mental activity at that time, even if the object is not the object of any single mental state or act. The fusion of \(X\)’s afterimage and \(Y\)’s headache is mind-dependent in the second sense but not the first. That is a reason to prefer the second account of mind-dependence."

With this in mind, consider the set whose sole members are X’s afterimage and Y’s headache, or some more complex set-theoretic object based on these items.

Second, while the approach may well draw an important line, it inherits one familiar problem, namely, that of saying what it is for a thing to be a physical object (Crane and Mellor 1990; for discussion, see the entry on  physicalism).  In one sense, a physical entity is an entity in which physics might take an interest. But physics is saturated with mathematics, so in this sense a great many paradigmatically abstract objects—e.g. \(\pi\)—will count as physical. The intended point is that abstract objects are to be distinguished, not from all of the objects posited by physics, but from the concrete objects posited by the physics. But if that is the point, it is unilluminating in the present context to say that abstract objects are non-physical."

It is not unnatural to say that a set of books is located on a certain shelf in the library, and indeed, there are some theoretical reasons for wanting to say this (Maddy 1990).

So, the ontological status of spatiotemporal locations, and of spatial and temporal locations, is problematic. Let us suppose that space, or spacetime, exists, not just as an object of pure mathematics, but as the arena in which physical objects and events are somehow arrayed. It is essential to understand that the problem is not about the numerical coordinates that represent these points and regions (or instants and intervals) in a reference system; the issue is about the points and regions (or instants and intervals). Physical objects are located ‘in’ or ‘at’ regions of space; as a result, they count as concrete according to the non-spatiality criterion. But what about the points and regions of space itself? There has been some debate about whether a commitment to spacetime substantivalism is consistent with the nominalist’s rejection of abstract entities (Field 1980, 1989; Malament 1982). If we define the abstract as the ‘non-spatial’, this debate amounts to whether space itself is to be reckoned ‘spatial’. To reject that these points, regions, instants, and intervals, are concrete because they are not located, entails featuring them as abstract.

The rock’s hitting the window is an event in which the rock ‘participates’ in a certain way, and it is because the rock participates in events in this way that we credit the rock itself with causal efficacy. But what is it for an object to participate in an event? Suppose John is thinking about the Pythagorean Theorem and you ask him to say what’s on his mind. His response is an event—the utterance of a sentence; and one of its causes is the event of John’s thinking about the theorem. Does the Pythagorean Theorem ‘participate’ in this event? There is surely some sense in which it does. The event consists in John’s coming to stand in a certain relation to the theorem, just as the rock’s hitting the window consists in the rock’s coming to stand in a certain relation to the glass.

Obviously, this has the problematic consequence of having some sets—pure sets—as abstract and other sets—impure sets—as concrete.

It is a formal, axiomatic metaphysical theory of objects (both abstract and concrete), and also includes a theory of properties, relations, and propositions. The theory explicitly defines the notion of an abstract object but also implicitly characterizes them using  axioms.[9]  There are three central aspects to the theory: (i) a predicate \(E!\) which applies to concrete entities and which is used to define a modal distinction between abstract and ordinary objects; (ii) a distinction between exemplifying relations and encoding properties (i.e., encoding 1-place relations); and (iii) a comprehension schema that asserts the conditions under which abstract objects exist."

On this interpretation, a formula such as \(\exists x \neg E!x\), which is implied by the axioms described below, asserts “there is an object that fails to exist”. So, on this interpretation, the theory is Meinongian because it endorses non-existent objects. But there is a Quinean interpretation as well, on which the quantifier \(\exists\) asserts existence and the predicate \(E!\) asserts concreteness. On this interpretation, the formula \(\exists x \neg E!x\) asserts “there exists an object that fails to be concrete”.

Though Zalta’s definition of abstract seems to comport with the way of primitivism—take concrete as primitive, and then define abstract as not possibly concrete—it differs in that (a) axioms are stated that govern the conditions under which abstract objects exist (see below), and (b) the features commonly ascribed to abstract objects are derived from principles that govern the property of being concrete. For example, Zalta accepts principles such as: necessarily, anything with causal powers is concrete (i.e., \(\Box \forall x(Cx \to E!x)\)).

On this reading, the definitions and axioms of the theory convey what is meant by encoding and how it works. Intuitively, an abstract object encodes the properties by which we define or conceive of it, but exemplifies some properties contingently and others necessarily. Thus, the number 1 of Dedekind-Peano number theory encodes all and only its number-theoretic properties, and whereas it contingently exemplifies the property being thought about by Peano, it necessarily exemplifies properties such as being abstract, not having a shape, not being a building, etc. The distinction between exemplifying and encoding a property is also used to define identity: ordinary objects are identical whenever they necessarily exemplify the same properties while abstract objects are identical whenever they necessarily encode the same properties."

Since she is not trying to find ultimate categories or a definitive list of basic (abstract or concrete) objects, she prefers a simpler kind of realism (see Thomasson 2015, 145–158). She argues that everyday uses of existential statements provide acceptable ontological commitments when those assertions are supported either by empirical evidence or merely by the rules of use that govern general terms (e.g., sortal terms); in both cases she says that “application conditions” for a general term are fulfilled (see Thomasson 2015, 86, 89–95).

Instead, the point is that the seemingly unproblematic claim \(Rab\) renders the claim \(f(a) \! =\! f(b)\) unproblematic, and this is best expressed by sufficiency statements of the form \(Rab \Rightarrow f(a) \! =\! f(b)\), on which the left side grounds the right side.

Linnebo calls such symmetric and transitive relations unity relations. When a sufficiency statement—\(Rab \Rightarrow f(a) \! =\! f(b)\)—holds, then new objects are identified. The new objects are specified in terms of the less problematic entities related by \(R\); for example, directions become specified by lines that are parallel. According to Linnebo, the parallel lines become specifications of the new objects. A unity relation \(R\) is therefore the starting point for developing a sufficient (but not necessary and sufficient) condition for reference."

Suppose \(Rab\) asserts \(a\) and \(b\) are spatiotemporal parts of the same cohesive and naturally bounded whole. Then \(a\) and \(b\) become specifications for physical bodies via the following principle: \(Rab \Rightarrow \mathrm{Body}(a) \! =\! \mathrm{Body}(b)\). In this case, the principle “makes a substantial demand on the world” because it requires checking that there are spatiotemporal parts constituting a continuous stretch of solid stuff (just looking at the spatiotemporal parts does not suffice to determine whether they constitute to a body; see Linnebo 2018, 45)."

The mereological sum of your left hand and your laptop makes no demand on the world beyond the demands of its  parts.[19]  Instead, he suggests that abstract objects are those that are thin and that have a shallow nature. The notion of shallow nature is meant to capture “the intuitive idea that any question that is solely about \(F\text{s}\) has an answer that can be determined on the basis of any given specifications of these \(F\text{s}\)” (2018, 192–195). For example, directions have a shallow nature because any question about directions (e.g., are they orthogonal, etc.?) can be determined solely on the basis of the lines that specify them. Shapes have a shallow nature because any question about them (e.g., are they triangular, circular, etc.?) can be determined solely on the basis of their underlying concrete figures. By contrast, mereological sums of concrete objects are not shallow because there are questions about them that cannot be answered solely on the basis of their specifications; for instance, the weight of the mereological sum of your laptop and your left hand depends not only on their combination but also on the gravitational field in which they are  located.[20]  "

Linnebo extends this view in several ways. He constructs an account of mathematical objects that goes beyond the way of abstraction principles by providing a reconstruction of set theory in terms of ‘dynamic abstraction’ (2018, ch. 3). This form of minimalism also allows for abstract objects of a mixed nature; namely, those that are thin relative to other objects. For example, the type of the letter ‘A’ is abstract because it is thin and has a shallow nature, but it is thin with respect the tokens of the letter ‘A’."

Another problem (2018, 195) is that in order for an object to count as having a shallow nature, an intrinsic unity relation has to be available. An investigation is required to establish that there is such an intrinsic unity relation in each case. It is far from clear that a conditional principle with an intrinsic unity relation is available for each of problematic cases mentioned in this entry, such as chess, legal institutions or the English language.

Moltmann (2013) investigates the extent to which abstract objects are needed when developing a semantics of natural language; in this book, and also in her article (2020), she defends a ‘core-periphery’ distinction and suggests that natural language ontology contains references to abstract objects only in its periphery.

According to the basic modal characterization, any such property, if possessed by a contingently existing object, will be counted as an accidental property of that object. But this seems wrong. Consider the property of being a dog. It is plausible (and for present purposes we assume it is true) that an object must exist in order to possess this property. Now consider a particular dog named ‘Emma’, who in fact exists but who might not have existed. There is a possible world in which Emma does not exist. And in this world (given our assumption) Emma is not a dog, since Emma does not exist there. So, according to the basic modal characterization, being a dog is an accidental property of Emma.

Those who favor the basic characterization can say that typically when someone claims, for example, that Emma is essentially a dog, what is really meant is not that Emma has essentially the property of being a dog, but instead that Emma has essentially the property of being a dog if existent. Existence will be treated specially on this approach: the claim that an object has existence as an essential property will not be taken as the claim that the object has as an essential property the property of being existent if existent; instead the claim will be taken at face value. Those who favor the existence-conditioned characterization can say that when someone says that only God has existence as an essential property, what is really meant is that only God has existence as a necessary property, where a necessary property of an object is a property that the object possesses in all possible worlds. (According to the basic modal characterization, an essential property is the same as a necessary property.) Both approaches may be faulted for making a special case of the property of existence. But that is not perhaps such a great fault, given that existence does seem to be a special case and that it is treated specially in other areas of philosophy as well. (It is perhaps worth pointing out that according to many philosophers—Kant, Russell, and Frege to name three—existence is not a property at all. If this is right, then existence is indeed a very special case.) In what follows, we shall not be concerned with the details arising from the need for some sort of existence condition—either in the statement of the definition of an essential property (as on the existence-conditioned modal characterization) or in the properties that are taken to be essential (as on the basic modal characterization).

It is natural to understand her as saying that she does not know that Socrates did not go to Sparta. Thus, the possibility that is expressed here is a kind of epistemic possibility (in particular, one according to which \(p\) is epistemically possible for an agent \(X\) just in case not-\(p\) is not known by \(X)\). This notion of epistemic possibility is clearly distinct from the notion of metaphysical possibility, since there are cases of epistemic possibilities that are not metaphysical possibilities. Of Goldbach’s Conjecture (that every even number greater than two is the sum of two primes) and its denial, each is epistemically possible but one (we know not which) is not metaphysically possible. And there are cases of metaphysical possibilities that are not epistemic possibilities. That there are only two planets in our solar system is metaphysically possible but not epistemically possible for most of us, given that most of us know that there are not only two planets in our solar system.

Of course, any property that a person could not lack is one that that person could not lose, since by losing a property the person comes to lack it. Still, the “reverse” does not hold.

But however well this account fits with (this aspect of) our everyday understanding of essentiality, it has some consequences that may be surprising: this characterization classifies the property of being such that there are infinitely many primes (or, perhaps, being such that there are infinitely many primes if the thing in question is existent) as essential to Socrates (as well as to all other things), since Socrates (like all other things) must have this property. Socrates must have this property for the simple reason that it is necessary that there are infinitely many primes.

Fine thinks that the notion of an essential property of a thing should be bound up with the notion of the thing’s nature or what it is to be that thing, but, Fine thinks, being such that there are infinitely many primes intuitively has nothing to do with what it is to be Socrates. And although it seems that having the number 2 as its sole member is part of what it is to be the unit set \(\{2\}\), it does not seem that being this unit set’s sole member is part of what it is to be the number 2. It is Fine’s view that these sorts of properties are counterexamples to the modal  characterization.[2][3]  To replace the modal characterization, Fine offers a definitional characterization of essential properties, according to which the essential properties of an object are those of its properties that are part of the object’s “definition”. What exactly is a “definition” of an object? This is a difficult question. At first sight, it seems to be a category mistake: it is words and perhaps concepts—but not objects—that have definitions. Even so, it must be admitted that some objects—such as the number 2 and the unit set \(\{2\}\)—do seem to be definable: it is plausible to think that the number 2 is defined as being the successor of the number 1; and it is plausible to think that the unit set \(\{2\}\) is defined as being the set whose sole member is the number 2. But other objects—such as Socrates—do not seem to admit so readily of definition. So even if the notion is understood well enough for some objects (never mind that not everyone would allow that the number 2, for example, is an object), a major challenge for the advocate of the definitional characterization is to provide a respectable general understanding of the notion of a definition for an object."

According to Brogaard and Salerno, counterfactuals with impossible antecedents (“counterpossibles”) can be false (rather than being “vacuously true,” as standard accounts would have it). For example, Brogaard and Salerno would say that the following counterfactual is false: If nothing had the property of being such that there are infinitely many primes, then Socrates would not exist. Since this counterfactual is false, condition (2) is not satisfied. Thus, Socrates is not essentially such that there are infinitely many primes."

It agrees with the definitional characterization that the modal characterization is too liberal in what it counts as essential, but it avoids appeal to the notion of a definition of an object. On the explanatory characterization, the essential properties of an object are the object’s deepest explanatory properties—those properties that figure fundamentally into explanations of the object’s possessing the other properties it does. (For example, having six protons might count as an essential property of a carbon atom because this property figures fundamentally into explanations of its possession of other properties, like its bonding characteristics.) This sort of account threatens to make the essential/accidental property distinction relative, since what counts as explanatorily primary seems to depend on the interests and abilities of the explainers. Some advocates of the explanatory characterization, such as Meghan Sullivan (2017), are willing to accept that the distinction is relative in some sense. Others, such as Irving Copi (1954) and Michael Gorman (2005), hold that there is a more “metaphysical” and less “epistemic” understanding of the notion of explanation, according to which one thing explains another thing just in case there is a certain mind-independent relation that holds between them. Just as the advocate of the definitional characterization is challenged to provide a respectable understanding of the relevant notion of definition, the advocate of the explanatory characterization is challenged to provide (or to borrow from the philosophy of science) a respectable understanding of the relevant notion of explanation."

Starting at one extreme, there is maximal essentialism. Although Leibniz famously held this view, it nearly goes without saying that this view has had relatively few adherents. According to a less extreme and correspondingly more popular form of essentialism, origin essentialism, an object could not have had a radically different origin than it in fact had. The view that a particular table could not have been originally made from completely different material than the material from which it was actually originally made and the view that a person could not have originated from a different sperm and egg than those from which he or she actually originated are both forms of origin essentialism. Origin essentialism has been defended by Kripke (1972/1980) Salmon (1981), and Forbes (1985), among others. According to another moderate form of essentialism, sortal essentialism, an object could not have been of a radically different kind—at least for certain kinds—than it in fact is. Both the view that being human (or being human if existent) is an essential property of Socrates and the view that Socrates could not have been a credit card account are forms of sortal essentialism. The mildest form of essentialism is minimal essentialism. Mackie (2006) offers a sustained defense of roughly this view."

The core intuitions are that in any possible world anything that is not an animal is not a cat and that in any possible world anything that is not composed of molecules of H2O is not water. Since we discovered empirically that cats are animals (and not, for example, robots) and that water is H2O (and not some other type of molecule), each of these claims asserts a necessary a posteriori connection between two properties. In the first case, what is asserted is that it is necessary that anything that is a cat is an animal. In the second case, what is asserted is that necessarily anything that is (a sample of) water is composed of molecules of  H2O.[6]  It is natural to construe these claims on the model of the essentialist claims we have so far considered: it is essential to a particular object, namely the species cat, to be such that all of its instances are also instances of the kind animal; it is essential to a particular object, namely the kind water, to be such that all samples of it are composed of molecules of H2O. Notice that one may hold that cats are essentially animals in the sense that there is a necessary a posteriori connection between the property of being a cat and the property of being an animal, without holding that any particular cat is essentially an animal. In other words, from the fact that it is necessary that every individual that is a cat is an animal, it does not follow that every individual that is in fact a cat is such that necessarily it is an animal. In still other words, this type of essentialism about natural kinds does not entail sortal essentialism."

A trivial example of an individual essence is a haecceity or thisness of an object, the property of being (identical to) that very object. Some have defended the claim that there are substantive examples of individual essences. Leibniz famously held that there are, and that they can be given by purely qualitative (general) properties. Forbes (1985) also holds that there are substantive individual essences, but he disagrees with Leibniz that they can be given by purely qualitative properties. Instead, he thinks, an individual essence involves non-purely qualitative (singular) properties: for example, Socrates’s essence involves originating from the particular sperm and egg from which he actually originated.

Skeptics about essentialism have doubted the very intelligibility of such a question. Here is one prominent thought behind such anti-essentialism. (See Quine 1960, pp. 195–200.) Since it is necessary that seven plus two is greater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as ‘seven plus two’ it is essentially greater than seven. But, since it is not necessary that the number of planets is greater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as ‘the number of planets’ it is not essentially greater than seven. The point is supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the number nine, independently of any way of referring to it, that it is or is not essentially greater than seven. Similarly, an anti-essentialist might say that when a person who is both a mathematician and a cyclist is thought of as a mathematician, being rational is essential to him, while being two-legged is not; but when the very same person is thought of as a cyclist, then although being two-legged is essential to him, being rational is not. Again, the point is supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the very person who is the mathematical cyclist, independently of any way of thinking about him, that he is or is not essentially rational (or two-legged). According to the anti-essentialist, asking whether Andrew Wiles (who we may suppose is a cycling mathematician) could fail to be rational is like asking whether Andrew Wiles is taller than—both questions demand another relatum. Could he fail to be rational, relative to what way of referring to him? Is he taller than whom?"

Consider the object that is referred to by all these phrases: ‘nine’, ‘seven plus two’, ‘the number of planets’. Could that very object have failed to be greater than seven? Intuitively the question seems intelligible, and the answer seems to be that it could not have failed to be greater than seven. According to intuition then, the very object that is referred to by ‘the number of planets’ (which is the very same object that is referred to by ‘seven plus two’ and ‘nine’) is essentially greater than seven. Intuition also has it that the claim that the number of planets is greater than seven is not itself necessary. To add some jargon: Intuition has it that the claim that it is necessary that the number of planets is greater than seven is true read de re (“of the thing”), but false read de dicto (“of the dictum” or “of the statement”). (The de re reading is this: the number of planets has the property of being necessarily greater than seven. The de dicto reading is this: the claim that the number of planets is greater than seven has the property of being necessary.)

For example, our knowledge that originating from \(s\) and \(e\) is essential to Socrates is based in part on our a priori knowledge that every organism has its origin essentially and in part on our empirical knowledge that Socrates (is an organism that) originated from \(s\) and \(e\). (Similarly our knowledge that Socrates is essentially human appears to be based in part on our a priori knowledge that everything has its kind essentially and in part on our empirical knowledge that Socrates is (of the kind) human.) Thus, our knowledge of the claim that originating from \(s\) and \(e\) is essential to Socrates should be no more problematic epistemologically than our knowledge of the two claims on which it is based and our knowledge of the validity of the argument from those two claims. As we have already mentioned, although there are difficult philosophical issues concerning our knowledge of logical truths, our knowledge of the validity of the argument in question does not seem to add any special problems of its own. Similarly, although there are philosophical issues concerning empirical knowledge, our knowledge that Socrates originated from \(s\) and \(e\) does not appear to add any special problems. However our a priori knowledge that every organism has its origin essentially does seem to have special problems over and above the problems associated with accounting for our a priori knowledge of logic, mathematics, and the homelier necessary truths. The latter claims are generally supported by universally held intuitions or by arguments that are universally accepted whereas the former, like most philosophical claims, is supported by a less robust intuition and by a more controversial argument.

If you know, for example, that Charles is a philosophy major and that Yoko is not, then you can safely infer that Charles is not identical to Yoko. Essentialist claims have played a role in some prominent Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentity theses. A certain brand of mind-body dualism may be argued for in the following way: \(X\) is essentially a thinking thing; \(X\)’s body is not essentially a thinking thing; so \(X\) is not (identical to) \(X\)’s body. A similar argument can be given for the conclusion that a statue is not identical with the lump of material (wax, clay, marble, or what have you) that constitutes it. Consider a human-shaped statue—call it ‘Goliath’—and the lump of wax that composes it—call it ‘Lump\(_1\)’. Goliath, we may imagine, is throughout its entire existence composed of Lump\(_1\) while Lump\(_1\) throughout its entire existence composes Goliath. In this case, Goliath and Lump\(_1\) are spatiotemporally colocated, which is just to say that they occupy the exact same spatial region at any given time whenever either of them exists. This being the case, they share most of their properties: Goliath weighs 17 kilograms and so does Lump\(_1\); Goliath has a white surface and so does Lump\(_1\); and so on. In fact, it may seem curious that we are writing as though there are two things at all. Why not say simply that Goliath and Lump\(_1\) are identical?

And the reasoning looks impeccable: if Goliath were Lump\(_1\), then each would have to have all of the same properties as “the other”; since they have different properties, they must not be identical. (Few things in philosophy are as uncontroversial as Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, though there has been some dispute about the proper way of formulating it.) Figuring out how to reconcile our intuitions that (1) and (2) are true with our tendency to think that Goliath and Lump\(_1\) are not really two things but just one is a version of the problem of material constitution. There are a wide variety of ways to deal with this problem. A “two-thinger”—one who thinks that there really are two things, a statue and a lump of wax, in one location—may simply eschew the tendency to identify Goliath and Lump\(_1\). Other responses suggest that there is something amiss with Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentities when there is this kind of an appeal to essential properties: Della Rocca (1996c) holds that such arguments are question begging; Lewis (1971) and Noonan (1991) hold that they are invalid; and Burke (1994) and Rea (2000) hold that in any such argument, at least one of the premises is false. For those who are interested, Rea (1997) is a good place to start to delve more deeply into this problem."
648,648,Action,1. About the Question: What is an Action?,,72,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," The central question in philosophy of action is standardly taken to be: “What makes something an action?” However, we obtain different versions of the question depending on what we take as the contrast class from which actions are to be differentiated. The different questions in turn encode important presuppositions. First, we may understand the question as asking us to differentiate between intentional action and the notions of acting and activity considered above (cf. Hyman 2015). Most commonly, however, the question is taken in terms of Wittgenstein’s classic formulation: “What is left over if I subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that I raise my arm?” (1953 [2010], §621). A common, though contested, reading of this passage is this: there are certain events of an arm’s going up that are actions, and some that are not (e.g. if someone tickles me in my sleep). What further factor does the action have that the event resulting from tickling lacks?"
649,649,Action,1. About the Question: What is an Action?,,73,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Many historical as well as contemporary thinkers hope to answer just this question. A simple answer, common in the early modern period (e.g. Descartes 1641 AT VII 57; Hobbes 1651/1668, i.6; Hume 1739–1740 T II.3.iii; SB 413–18), is that what distinguishes actions from other events is that they are the causal outcomes of desires, volitions, or acts of will. A modern version of this view, considered below, appeals instead to intentions, regarded as distinctive mental states. Despite the intuitiveness of these “standard” answers, there have been increasing worries that they are based on disputable assumptions. First, there is an assumption about the metaphysical category to which actions belong. Although it is natural to take them as events, some philosophers have argued that there are good reasons to group them under a different category. Second, the common reading of Wittgenstein’s question presupposes what has been called “additive” or “decompositional” conceptions of action (Ford 2011; Lavin 2015, 2013; cf. Boyle 2016): it is assumed that an account of action can be given in terms of distinct, and simpler components. However, a number of authors have argued that this reductive project is bound to fail (Anscombe 1995; Vogler 2001; O’Brien 2012; Levy 2013; Horst 2015; Valaris 2015; Della Rocca 2020, ch.4)."
650,650,Action,1. About the Question: What is an Action?,,74,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," It has also been contended that philosophers who offer the standard answers make important methodological assumptions. These philosophers approach questions about agency as though they were on par with scientific questions to this extent: they seek mechanistic, or causal explanations of agency, explanations that can be grasped from an objective perspective. However, drawing inspiration from Kant, some philosophers contend that philosophy of action should be done from the agential perspective (Nagel 1989; Korsgaard 2009; Bilgrami 2012; Schapiro 2021); and other philosophers drawing from Aristotle and Frege have argued for similar views (Thompson 2008; Lavin 2013; Ford 2017). From a different standpoint, the standard methodology has been criticized as not being scientific enough. It has been argued that certain empirical results disprove some of the basic assumptions behind these answers. For example, Libet’s experiments have been taken to suggest that intentions are causally ineffective, and that to understand the true causes of action we would have to focus on neural processes (‘action potentials’) about which we could only learn through standard scientific methods (Libet 1985; Libet et al. 1993). Although these radical views are now widely held to be based on faulty conceptual and empirical grounds (e.g. Mele. 2010; Levy 2005; Brass, Furstenberg, and Mele 2019), surprising scientific results continue to challenge commonly held views in philosophy of action (see e.g. Wegner 2002 and Nahmias 2014 for critical discussion of recent findings)."

652,652,Action,2. Causalism and Causal Theories of Action,,76,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Possibly the most widespread and accepted theory of intentional action (though by no means without its challengers) is the causal theory of action, a theory according to which something counts as an intentional action in virtue of its causal connection to certain mental states. In fact, this view is often dubbed (following Velleman 1992) the ‘standard story of action’. Although other philosophers proposed similar views before, the contemporary causal theory of action, or “causalism,” was pioneered by Donald Davidson, especially the essays collected in Davidson (2001a). Davidson has contributed to many topics in the philosophy of action, such as action individuation, the logical form of action sentences, the relation between intention and evaluative judgments, among others, but here we will focus mostly on his arguments for, and his formulation of, the causal theory of action. In Action, Reasons, and Causes (ARC), Davidson provides an account of the nature of rationalizing explanations of actions, or what is often called ‘intentional explanations’. Such explanations explain the action by providing the reason why the agent acted. ARC tries to understand how a reason can explain an action. The two central theses of ARC, or modified versions of them, became subsequently widely, though certainly not universally, accepted. The first thesis is that the explanation of an action involves a “primary reason”: a belief and a desire pair that rationalizes the action by expressing the end pursued in the action (desire) and how the agent thought the action would accomplish this end (instrumental belief). So, for instance, in “Larry went to Gus the Barber because he wanted a haircut”, Larry’s action is explained by a desire (his wanting a haircut) and a belief, left implicit in this case (his believing that he could get a haircut by going to Gus the Barber). The second central thesis is that the primary reason is also the cause of the action."
653,653,Action,2. Causalism and Causal Theories of Action,2.1 Davidson’s Predecessors and the Central Arguments in the Debate,0,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Davidson’s view in ARC is presented against a number of philosophers (mostly influenced by Wittgenstein), who, on his view, take action explanations to provide a different kind of understanding than causal explanations (for a sympathetic overview of this Wittgenstein-inspired work, see Sandis 2015). Some of the identified targets of the paper (such as Melden 1961) are clearly arguing for the views Davidson rejects. Others (such as Anscombe 1957 and Ryle 1949) do not clearly embrace the theses Davidson objects to, or at least not all of them. These philosophers took intentional explanations to display how an action is made intelligible or justified. So Melden says that “citing a motive [gives] a fuller characterization of the action; it [provides] a better understanding of what the [agent] is doing” (Melden 1961, 88). Similarly, Anscombe’s special sense of the question “Why?’, discussed below (section 4.1), is supposed to pick out the particular way in which actions are explained. This claim is not one that Davidson denies; according to Davidson, in intentional explanations, or ‘rationalizations’, ”the agent is shown in his Role of Rational Animal … There is an irreducible … sense in which every rationalization justifies: from the agent’s point of view there was, when he acted, something to be said for the action.“ (Davidson 1963, 690–1). But Melden, and other Wittgensteineans, argue that this kind of explanation cannot be a causal explanation. Melden’s central argument is the ”logical connection“ argument. According to Melden, since the supposedly causal antecedents of an action (mental items such as desires and intentions) are logically related to the intentional action (I would not count as intentionally signalling a turn if I did not desire/intend to signal a turn), the explanation of the action in terms of such mental items cannot be an explanation in terms of ”Humean causes“. After all, Humean causation connects events that are logically independent."
654,654,Action,2. Causalism and Causal Theories of Action,2.1 Davidson’s Predecessors and the Central Arguments in the Debate,1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Davidson’s ARC exposes a crucial fallacy with Melden’s argument (similar problems had been pointed out by Annette Baier (then Annette Stoop) in Stoop 1962). Accepting Hume’s account of causal relations does not commit us to the view that any description of a cause is logically independent of any description of its effect. An event can only be described as ”sunburning“ if it is caused by exposure to the sun, but this does not mean that the cause of a sunburn is not a ”separate entity“ from the sunburn. We can describe an event as ”The event that caused X“ without thereby refuting Humeanism about causation. Davidson argues that, on the contrary, the mental items cited in an action explanation can only explain the action if they are also the cause of the action (the second central thesis of ARC). In our example above, Larry might have had other belief-desire pairs that rationalized his action of going to the barber. For instance, Larry might also have wanted a bottle of cream soda and believed that he could procure such an item at Gus the Barber. However, he did not (we may stipulate) go there because he wanted cream soda but because he wanted a haircut (and believed he could get one at Gus the Barber). The only way we can explain the difference between potentially rationalizing, but non-explanatory belief-desire pairs, is that the belief-desire pair that genuinely explains the action, the primary reason, also causes the action. The question of how non-causal theories can distinguish between merely potentially explanatory reasons for an action from the reasons that actually explain it became known as ”Davidson’s Challenge“ to non-causal theories of action (Mele 1992; Mele 2013)."
655,655,Action,2. Causalism and Causal Theories of Action,2.2 Davidson on the Nature of Intentional Actions,0,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Although initially presented as an account of the nature of action explanation, Davidson’s account also contains the basic structure of an understanding of human action: according to Davidson, a true action statement (of the form ”x φ-ed“) denotes an event, and more specifically, a bodily movement. A bodily movement is an action if, and only if, the event is an intentional action (Davidson 1971). Davidson does not say this  explicitly,[2]  but clearly on his view, an event is an intentional action under a certain description, if and only if, there is a true rationalizing explanation of the event under this description. Davidson (1971) (following Anscombe) points out that ”x φ-ed intentionally“ creates an intensional context; that is whether an action is intentional depends on how the action is described. To use Davidson’s example, if I flip a switch, I also turn on the light, and alert the burglar. On Davidson’s view ”flipping the switch“, ”turning on the light“, and ”alerting the burglar“ are all descriptions of the same action. The ”accordion effect“ (so dubbed by Feinberg 1965), characteristic of human action, makes it the case that the causal consequences of an intentional action provide further descriptions of human actions. If my flipping the switch caused the light to go on and the burglar to be alerted, then I also turned the light on and alerted the burglar. However, only the first two are intentional actions. On Davidson’s view, all these descriptions are descriptions of the same action; alerting the burglar is an action in virtue of the fact that these same bodily movements, under a different description, are a case of intentional action (flipping the switch). Thus Davidson concludes that, ”we never do more than move our bodies: the rest is up to nature“ (Davidson 1971, 23). We can see now how the claims developed in these papers provide us with a theory of action: an action is a bodily movement such that, under some description, the bodily movement is causally explained by a primary reason."

Causalism and Causal Theories of Action,2.2 Davidson on the Nature of Intentional Actions,1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," This also gives us the barebones of a causal theory of action: according to ”causalists“, intentional action is explained in terms of mental states that are the causal antecedents, or concomitants, of the agent’s behaviour or bodily movement. Subsequent to Davidson, causalists have aimed to provide reductive explanations: intentional action is identified with behaviour or bodily movement (or in less ”ambitious“ versions of the view, a more general form of action, see Setiya 2011) whose causal antecedents (or concomitants) are certain specified mental states. Although Davidson himself is often portrayed as proposing a reductive analysis, he never presents any of his views as fulfilling such ambition and expresses skepticism that such analysis is possible given the problem of deviance (see below)."
657,657,Action,2. Causalism and Causal Theories of Action,2.3 Mental states as the causal explanans of actions,0,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," The idea that an action is rationalized by its mental states is still very popular; much less so is the view that the only relevant states are beliefs and desires (though see Sinhababu 2017 for a modern defense of this simple ”Humean“ account). As Bratman (1987) argues, desires do not have the conduct-controlling and settling functions characteristic of intentions, and thus intentions seem to be better placed to be at the center of an account in which intentional actions are constituted by their causal genesis. My desire to have my teeth cleaned, when conjoined with my belief that in order to get my teeth cleaned I need to go to a dentist, will not result in my moving towards the dentist until I actually intend to go to the dentist. In fact, when Velleman comes to dub this kind of causal theory of action ”the standard story of action“, he explicitly describes the view as one in which intention plays a central role between the ”primary reason“ and the action. In the standard story, the agent’s ”desire for the end, and his belief in the action as a means … jointly cause an intention to take it, which in turn causes the corresponding movements of the agent’s body.“ (Velleman 1992, 461). Davidson (1970b) himself came to accept that intentions play an important role in the causation and constitution of action and that intentions could not be reduced to beliefs or desires. But common to all these views is the idea that human actions are events that bear the right kind of causal relation to certain mental states or events of the agent that also explain the action."
658,658,Action,2. Causalism and Causal Theories of Action,2.3 Mental states as the causal explanans of actions,1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," One alternative to the causal view understands agency as a form of irreducible agent-causation. Chisholm (1964) presents a classic version of the view; Alvarez and Hyman (1998) presents a radically different version which denies that agents cause the actions themselves; Mayr (2011) develops a version of the view that, unlike Chisholm’s version, tries to show that human agency is not essentially different from other forms of substance causation that we find in the natural world. A second alternative sees intentional explanations as teleological rather than causal explanations (Wilson 1980; Cleveland 1997; Schueler 2003; Sehon 2005); that is, an intentional explanation cites the goal, the purpose, or the reason for which the agent acted rather than the antecedent causes of the action. Defenders of this view also try to provide an understanding of the teleological structure of intentional action that denies that teleological explanations reduce to causal explanations; they are instead a sui generis form of explanation. One way this view can meet Davidson’s Challenge is to argue that the truth of certain counterfactuals distinguishes potential reasons from the actual reasons. For instance, it could be true that even though the fact that the asparagus was delicious was a potential reason for Mary to eat asparagus, she would not have eaten them if they were not healthy and she would have eaten them even if they were not delicious (Löhrer and Sehon 2016); such counterfactuals, on this view, are not grounded on causal relations between mental states and the bodily movements, but on the teleological structures that constitute intentional action. Finally, the causal account also contrasts with the neo-Aristotelian view in which human action is constituted, roughly, by a special form of practical knowledge (Anscombe 1957); on this view, in intentional action, ”knowledge is the [formal] cause of what it understands“ (see section 4 of this entry)."

The first appeals to the notion of a “proximate cause” (Mele 1992) such that an action is intentional only if, for instance, the formation of an intention to φ is the proximate cause of your φ-ing. Another family of solutions appeal to sensitivity and feedback conditions (Peacocke 1979; Bishop 1989; Smith 2012): the climber’s bodily movements would not count as an intentional action because they would not be sensitive to variations in conditions and information on what needs to be done (the climber would not release their hands differently if the rope turned out to be stickier or would not change their behaviour if they were to realize that the rope had a safety latch fastened to their hips). A different type of approach (though with some relevant similarities to the latter) takes the central problem for the Davidsonian approach, the reason why the problem of deviance is endemic to Davidson’s causalism, to be the attempt to understand action in terms of its causal antecedents, rather than its sustaining causes. For Frankfurt (1978) the relevant causal mechanisms involved must be guiding the action. Given that action is a form of purposive behaviour, we cannot hope to understand what distinguishes action from mere bodily movements by focusing on what precedes the action, rather than by what happens while the agent is acting.

For example, it has been argued that cases of deviance involve lack of attention (Wu 2016), failures at the fine-grained level of motor (as opposed to distal and proximal) intentions (Mylopoulos and Pacherie 2019), or failures in the causal pathways responsible for flexible agency (Shepherd 2021)."

670,670,Action,3. Extended Action,,0,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Davidson’s work focuses mostly on “punctual actions”, actions that take place very quickly, and that have already occurred. A typical example of an action for Davidson will be described by a sentence like “α flicked the switch” (see Davidson 1971). Flicking a switch happens almost instantaneously; moreover, when I describe my action as “flicked the switch”, the sentence picks up a completed event in which the action is already done. And flicking a switch, buttering toast, etc. are actions typically performed from beginning to end without interruption. In sum, Davidson’s typical examples of actions are short-lived, continuous, and completed actions. Davidson’s conception of an intention follows a similar pattern, focusing on intentions that are executed in actions that follow the aforementioned pattern. At first, Davidson takes intentions in (short-lived) action to be primary, and later (Davidson 1970b) expands the model to prospective intention (intentions for a future action), but still focusing mostly on intentions for a simply executed action that happens to lie in the future. However our actions often extend through long stretches of time, and seem to rely on future-directed intentions that govern very complex plans and activities. Moreover, we only seem to have a completed action when we are no longer engaged in the relevant activity (when it is true that I’ve crossed the street I am no longer engaged in the activities that constitute or are means to having crossed the street); agency arguably manifests itself only in action in progress (I am engaged in these activities while I am crossing the street). By keeping our focus on completed action, we risk losing sight of another seemingly essential feature of human action: that it extends through time under the guidance of the agent. Of course, this kind of initial focus on nearly momentary, completed actions does not necessarily mean that the theory cannot accommodate extended action that requires complex planning or action in progress (or any form of agency that necessarily stretches through time). But a number of philosophers have tried to either expand, modify, or reject Davidson’s theory to account for extended agency or action in progress, or to argue that a proper theory of action should focus on the nature and structure of action in progress (Thompson 2008; Ford 2018). This section will focus on extended agency of the former kind, and the relevance of action in progress will be discussed in section 4."
671,671,Action,3. Extended Action,,1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Michael Bratman’s work (Bratman 1987; 1999a; 2007; 2018, among others) was seminal in arguing for the importance of intentions, policies, and plans (all of which he classifies as intentions or planning states) in our understanding of how limited rational beings coordinate their actions through time and can pursue ends and projects through extended periods of time. Bratman’s planning theory of agency starts from rejecting Davidson’s account of intention, and replacing it with a new understanding of the function (and nature) of intentions and planning states. Davidson had identified intention with an “all-out” or unconditional judgment, “which, if we were to express it in words, would have a form like ”This action is desirable’“ (Davidson 1970b, 55); that is, an intention is a distinctive kind of evaluative judgment (”this action is good“ or ”this action is desirable“). On this view, to intend to φ is to have φ-ing as the conclusion of one’s practical reasoning. Bratman finds this view problematic in many ways, but arguably his most important objection to Davidson’s view is that Davidson’s theory of intention misses out one of the ”two faces“ of intentions. Intentions, on Bratman’s views, are tied not only to intentional action but also to coordinating plans (Bratman 1987); Davidson’s identification of intentions with certain evaluative judgments seems incapable of making room for the latter ”face“. However, this role of future-directed intentions in planning and coordinating action through time is essential to agency. Among our future-directed intentions, there are very specific intentions to, say, make huevos rancheros for brunch later today, but also more complex plans and projects (my plan to write a book on tricycles is also a specific, though not significantly filled out, intention for a specific action or set of actions), and policies (my policy to exercise once a week is a ”repeatable“, general, intention to perform various futures  actions).[3]"
672,672,Action,3. Extended Action,,2,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Future-directed intentions have for Bratman at least two important functions in our deliberation: they have a settling function and a coordination function. Suppose I am deciding where I am spending my next vacation, and let us assume that I narrow it down to two possibilities: Poughkeepsie and Daytona Beach. At some point, typically much before my first vacation day, I will form an intention to go on one of these specific vacations (say to Daytona Beach), and this intention is independent of forming an evaluative judgment in favour of either option; I might be convinced that they are equally desirable, but I can only take one vacation a year. Forming the intention to go to Daytona Beach settles the question for me and ends deliberation on the matter. Since there is intrinsically no limit on how long I could spend deliberating, this settling function performs an important role in managing the cognitive resources of limited beings like us. But future-directed intentions also perform an important coordinating function in our extended agency. Going on vacation is a complex endeavour and we cannot successfully engage in this action without prior planning. If I am going to Daytona Beach, I need to plan how long I will stay, and what I will do when I am there, make hotel reservations, etc. These plans will also require more concrete plans as these actions unfold (if I plan to have snacks with me for the Indy-500, I need to plan which snacks, and then plan on where and when I will get them, and then plan on how I will get to the chosen grocery store, and so forth). Our capacity to form these different types of future-directed intentions (plans, policies, and more specific future-directed intentions) allows us to engage in these complex forms of extended agency (to be ”planning agents“ in Bratman’s words). In order to perform these functions, future-directed intentions must resist reconsideration and be stable through time. If I keep changing my mind after I form the intention to travel to Daytona Beach, my intention will not have settled the issue or foreclosed further deliberation. And it will also make both intrapersonal and interpersonal coordination impossible: if I expect I will change my mind, there’ll be no point in making hotel reservations at Daytona Beach. Moreover, these functions impose coherence constraints on my intentions: lack of means-ends coherence, for instance, will similarly prevent future-directed intention from functioning properly."

Bratman (1987) argues, for instance, that certain dispositions for nonreconsideration are essential to understanding the rationality of limited agents like ourselves. Holton (2004; 2009) extends Bratman’s account to another function of a future-directed intention: resisting temptation when we expect preferences and judgment shifts. We achieve this, according to Holton, by forming resolutions: intentions to remain firm in our intentions, which are harder to reconsider than simple desires or (first-order) intentions. (See Paul 2011a for some skepticism about this extension.)"
674,674,Action,3. Extended Action,,4,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Bratman also tries to expand his planning theory to explain the rationality of acting on a future-directed intention even in cases in which judgment or preference shifts might seem to justify acting otherwise. In earlier work, Bratman (1999b) appeals to a ”no-regret“ condition; roughly, a requirement that we should not reconsider or revise an intention if we’ll regret having done so at the conclusion of our planned actions. In later work, Bratman (2018) appeals to the end of self-governance, an end that is typically shared by human agents, to explain the rationality of sticking to one’s intentions in face of temptation (for somewhat similar ideas in the context of cooperation, see Velleman 1997). According to Bratman, self-governance is a form of agency in which the agent acts from a standpoint that is truly his own; a self-governing agent is guided ”by attitudes that constitute where he stands“ (Bratman 2018,  159).[4]  On this view, self-governance has both a synchronic and diachronic form. Synchronic self-governance requires a coherent practical standpoint at a time that can constitute where the agent stands in a coherent manner, while diachronic self-governance requires a coherent standpoint across different times when the agent’s plans stretch through an extended period. Since typically planning agents also have self-governance as one of their ends, the need for such a coherent standpoint generates reasons to conform to a requirement not to revise intentions not only in cases of temptation, but also in cases in which an agent forms a future-directed intention to choose one of a number of alternatives that are either indifferent or incommensurable. Even though in such cases an agent has sufficient reasons to act differently than she intends (since other options are just as good or at least on a par), self-governance requires that she preserves a coherent standpoint over time (for a different way to justify normative reasons against ”brute shuffling“ in terms of self-governance, see Paul 2014; for skepticism about some of these requirements against brute shuffling, see Ferrero 2010; Nefsky and Tenenbaum 2022)."

Tenenbaum (2018; 2020) argues that understanding better the nature of intentional action as actions that are always extended through time, and the nature of the instrumental reasoning involved in intentional action in progress, makes Bratman’s appeal to a sui generis state of future-directed intention superfluous in our understanding of practical rationality. On this view, there is no difference between the rational requirements governing the various phases of an action in progress and the requirements governing the execution of a plan that contains various steps, or of a general intention that contains various instances (and thus purported requirements that are specific to future-directed intentions turn out to be redundant or spurious)."

From the time I decide to make an omelet, to the time the finished product is on my plate, my agency unfolds in various stages and phases in pursuit of this end: I plan to make an omelet, I check which ingredients I need, I make sure that I leave myself enough time to go to the store while engaged in other activities in the morning, I buy the milk, go back home, melt the butter, break the eggs, drop them on the pan, and so forth. These are all parts, or phases, of the unfolding of the activity that, if nothing untoward happens, will result in my having made an omelet. Although we can impose various breaks and divide the process into ”intending“, ”preparing“, ”making the omelet“, these breaks are largely arbitrary from the point of view of the activity itself (Thompson 2008; Moran and Stone 2009; Ferrero 2017; Russell 2018); a metaphysics of intention that emphasizes differences risks losing sight of the continuity of the phenomena (for criticisms of these deflationary ideas about the differences between the various phases of the activity from intending to doing, see Yaffe 2010; Paul 2014)."

There are three theoretical forms by which a scientist grasps the truth: knowledge (epistêmê), wisdom (sophia), and comprehension (nous). Practical knowledge comes in two varieties: the knowledge of the skilled person about what she makes—skill (technê), and the knowledge of the virtuous person about her actions—practical wisdom (phronêsis)."

Practical Knowledge,4.1 The Nature of Practical Knowledge,1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Aristotle’s account of practical knowledge is complex, and our focus shall lie on three points of particular significance. First, Aristotle claimed that skill is the ”cause“ (aitia) of the things produced by it. For instance, he claimed that the craft of building is the cause of the house (Phys. 2.5, 196b26). Second, Aristotle imposed epistemic conditions on voluntary and, a fortiori, intentional action: according to him, to act voluntarily one must know, among other things, what one is doing, to whom, and why (NE 3.1 1111a3–6; EE 2.9 1225a36–b10). Third, Aristotle identified a distinctive kind of reasoning associated with practical knowledge, a form of reasoning traditionally rendered ”practical syllogism“ (though see Segvic 2011). Such reasoning begins from a certain good and its conclusion is an action. For instance, on the basis of thinking that walks are good after lunch, and that he has eaten lunch, a man might take a walk (DMA 7, 701a13–14). (For more on ancient views on action, see Parry 2021.)"
682,682,Action,4. Practical Knowledge,4.1 The Nature of Practical Knowledge,2,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Several mediaeval philosophers built on these Aristotelian ideas, especially to understand God’s knowledge of creation (see Schwenkler 2015). Anscombe (1957)’s account of practical knowledge draws on this tradition. She first characterizes intentional action as that to which a special sense of the question ”Why?“ applies, the sense that requests a reason for action (§5). Later, Anscombe appeals to Aristotle’s notion of practical reasoning to connect the notion of reason for action and the deliberative structure by which an agent determines how to attain a goal by acting (§33ff.). What the question ”Why?“ reveals, then, is the rational ”order“ of means-to-ends that define practical reasoning, and the answers reveal the descriptions under which the action is intentional."

Why? Because he is operating a pump. Why? Because he is pumping water. Why? Because he is poisoning the inhabitants of the house (you see, the water is poisoned). Why? Because he wants to kill them to bring world peace. The question ”Why?“ has application only inasmuch as the agent recognizes himself as acting under the corresponding descriptions expressed by his answers. As Anscombe notes, if the man were asked ”Why are you pumping water?“ and he replied, ”I was not aware I was doing that“, then he would not be acting intentionally under that description (§6; §42). The descriptions that manifest the agent’s understanding of what she is doing are therefore intrinsic to the action: an action does not count as intentional under a description unless the agent grasps the action as such (under that description). Such grasp, therefore, cannot be a separate occurrence (§42)."

Practical Knowledge,4.1 The Nature of Practical Knowledge,4,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," This reveals at least one important sense in which practical knowledge is the ”cause of what it understands“. It is the formal cause because the agent’s grasp determines what the action is (an intentional action with a determinate content). In turn, this shows why, in the phrase Anscombe borrows from Aristotle’s Magna Moralia, ”the mistake is in the performance“ when it doesn’t conform to the judgment (§32): qua formal cause, the knowledge sets the standard for what is known. Whether, like Aristotle, Anscombe holds that practical knowledge is also an efficient cause is a complex, and disputed question (see Setiya 2016a for skepticism, and Piñeros Glasscock 2020a for endorsement)."

This is because, intuitively, whereas I need to look at what is being written on the board to know what someone else is writing, I don’t need to look at what I am doing to know what I am writing. Beyond intuitive examples, however, it has proven difficult to explain what non-observational knowledge  is.[5]  Nevertheless, there are three points on which there is wide agreement. First, the class of practical knowledge is a proper subclass of the class of non-observational knowledge, one that also includes, for instance, knowledge of our limbs’s position (§§9–10). Second, to say that knowledge is non-observational is minimally to say that it is non-inferential. Third, and finally, the non-observational character of this knowledge is of the sort traditionally associated with mental states. Hence, one of the most remarkable theses of Intention is that public happenings—actions—could be known in the distinctive way traditionally reserved for internal mental states, so that there would be ”spontaneous knowledge of material reality“ (Rödl 2007, 121)."

687,687,Action,4. Practical Knowledge,4.2 Arguments for a knowledge condition,1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," One argument has already been mentioned: If a person is asked, “Why are you φ-ing?” and she (sincerely) replies, “I didn’t realize I was φ-ing” then she wasn’t φ-ing intentionally. It would seem to follow that a person must know what she is doing if acting intentionally. However, this argument is unsound. First, the expression “I didn’t realize…” is colloquially used to express complete lack of awareness, rather than mere ignorance (Schwenkler 2019, 189). At most, then, the argument would show that the action cannot be completely beyond the agent’s purview. Second, even if the person’s state is in fact knowledge after the question is asked, this may be a conversational effect: By asking “Why are you φ-ing?”, the speaker intimates that the agent is φ-ing. This puts the agent in a position to know this, but not in a way that is tied to her agency."

690,690,Action,4. Practical Knowledge,4.2 Arguments for a knowledge condition,4,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," There are two more influential arguments inspired by Anscombe that have been used to defend the connection with knowledge. The first begins with the observation that a process in progress bears a non-accidental connection to its completion (Thompson 2011; Small 2012; Wolfson 2012; Valaris 2021). If a house is burning, it would not be an accident if it is burnt later; and if you are writing a letter, it won’t be an accident if it is written later. What distinguishes intentional action is that the non-accidental connection obtains in virtue of the agent’s representation—her intention—to act in some way. That the agent is writing a letter—even while she takes a break, cooks a snack, and goes to the bathroom—is true precisely because she represents herself as writing a letter, and this representation guides her proceedings. Intentions, in other words ground what Falvey (2000) calls the “openness of the progressive”: the fact that “a person may be doing something, in a suitably broad sense, when at the moment she is not doing anything, in a more narrow sense, that is for the sake of what she is doing in the broad sense” (p.22). Suppose, then, that an agent is intentionally φ-ing. Then it is true that she represents herself as doing so, the representation is true, and non-accidentally so. It is a short step to the conclusion that she knows that she is φ-ing."
691,691,Action,4. Practical Knowledge,4.2 Arguments for a knowledge condition,5,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023", The final argument is based on the claim that intentional action is action for a reason (Thompson 2013).

If, then, every intentional action description is one that the agent could substitute for ψ in (1), it follows that agents must know what they are doing when acting intentionally."

697,697,Action,4. Practical Knowledge,4.3 Objections to the knowledge condition,3,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," For a long time, this and similar examples (e.g. Bratman 1987, 37, Mele 1992, ch.8) were taken as decisive refutations in the literature, but their force has been contested recently (Thompson 2011; Small 2012; Wolfson 2012; Stathopoulos 2016; Beddor and Pavese 2021; Pavese forthcoming). The impetus for many of these responses stems from Thompson’s work on the importance of aspect for action-theory. In particular, actions in progress display what Falvey (2000) has called “openness”, which corresponds to the inaptly-named “imperfective paradox” in the linguistic literature (more below): Someone can be doing something and never get around to have done it (e.g. I can be crossing the street, but never cross it). It is thus possible for someone to know that they are φ-ing even if they don’t, in fact, get to have φ-ed. To apply these considerations to Davidson’s argument, we need to distinguish between two cases. First, the normal case where the agent intends to make 10 carbon copies, but has the opportunity to correct and continue on if things go wrong (e.g. if he initially only makes 5, but then makes 5 more). Second, the one-shot case where the agent must make 10 carbon copies in one go (say, because he is competing in a copy-making tournament). In the normal case, it appears like the agent may know that he is making 10 carbon copies (even if he doesn’t know that he will complete the 10 in one go). So it raises no problems for the knowledge condition. What, then, of the one-shot case? Although here it may be granted that the agent doesn’t know that he is making 10 carbon copies, it is questionable whether he is making 10 carbon copies intentionally. The reason is that if he were to make 10 carbon copies as a result of pressing as hard as he can, this would be too much an accidental result of his performance. But, as we saw (see section 2.4), accidentality is incompatible with intentional action. Hence, in the normal case the agent acts intentionally while knowing, while in the one-shot case he doesn’t even act intentionally."

Suppose, however, that he is in fact filling up the cistern (it is not broken). If he does so to poison the inhabitants of the house, Anscombe’s question “Why?” appears to have application, which means that he is filling up the cistern intentionally, even though the best he could say is that “he thinks” he is doing so (Schwenkler 2019, 188–9; cf.

He argues that since agents can slowly transition from φ-ing to not-φ-ing through changes so small as to outstrip the agent’s discriminating capacities, agents must sometimes find themselves in situations where they are acting intentionally but either lack the confidence to possess knowledge, or, if they have it, it is misplaced.

703,703,Action,4. Practical Knowledge,4.4 Weakening the knowledge condition,1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Though regarded as Anscombe’s central opponent, Davidson himself recommended a version of (i). According to him, although agents need not know what they are doing under every description under which they act intentionally, they must know what they are doing under at least one description under which the action is intentional (Davidson 1971, 51). The carbon copier, for instance, may not know that he is making 10 carbon copies, but he would have to know that he is making carbon copies, or that he is moving his hands, etc. Arguably, the idea that practical knowledge is restricted to knowledge of actions in progress is also a weakening of the thesis, since Anscombe appears to include also knowledge of future actions (§§51–2) and of completed actions such as the knowledge that I wrote my name on the board (§48) or even of what is written (§19). Indeed, it has been argued that imperfective and perfective knowledge are interdependent (Haase 2018). Finally, other weakenings include the view that agents must know what they intend (Fleming 1964), what they are trying to do/that they are trying (Searle 1985; cf. Grice 1971), or what basic actions they are performing (Setiya 2008; 2009; 2012). Since Anscombe’s thesis is strictly stronger than these, it follows that they will avoid certain problems that hers faces. However, it is not clear that such retreats help avoid the general problem, and restricting the thesis to more immediate occurrences—basic actions, intentions, or attempts—risks losing on the aforementioned feature that makes Anscombe’s view so interesting: the idea that we might bear the same intimate epistemic connection to something external as we bear to parts of our mental lives (Piñeros Glasscock 2020b)."

A popular version of this view rejects a knowledge condition in favor of a belief condition (Setiya 2007; Velleman 2001; Ross 2009; Clark 2020): if the agent φs intentionally [intends to φ], she believes that she is φ-ing [believes that she will φ]. Such a view is arguably better supported by some of Anscombe’s own arguments (such as the argument in terms of conversation dynamics above); and it seems to preserve a special place for actions as occurrences that are public but to which our minds bear a special epistemic relation. However, it has been argued that such views also suffer from problems, and fail to avoid counterexamples with the same structure as Davidson’s carbon copier, even though they are explanatorily weaker (Bratman 1991; Paul 2009a; 2009b; Levy 2018).

Minimally, epistemic warrant is also needed, but the simple account does not give even a hint as to how such warrant could be acquired through agency (Newstead 2006). Second, there are notorious cases that seem to meet the conditions provided by the simple answer, but where there isn’t knowledge. One case is lucky wishful thinking (Langton 2004), e.g., if partly on the basis of optimistic thinking I luckily pull off a jump I would not normally make. Another is pessimistic thinking (Harman 1986; 1997), e.g., if I trip partly on the basis of thinking that I will trip. In neither case do I possess knowledge on the basis of my thoughts, despite the thoughts bringing about the truth of their contents.

Suppose, then, that someone has the thought <I will go to the store in virtue of this thought>. Then, given the desire to know herself, the agent will be motivated to make this thought true. Hence, thought structures of this sort (‘intentions’) will give the agent reasons to believe that what she intends will be true."

One is that it makes dubious empirical claims, theorizing about the mind from the armchair. In response, Velleman (2000a) has provided empirical support for his more contentious psychological claim, that humans have a deep desire for self-knowledge. Another worry is that this epistemic mechanism still looks too much like wishful thinking, believing that something is the case just because one wants it to be so (Langton 2004; see Setiya 2008; Velleman 2014 for replies). Finally, it is unclear why, if an agent realizes that the content of her intention is not realized, she must make it true that it is, rather than simply give up the belief (that she will act in a certain way). After all, we can pursue the aim of knowing ourselves both by ensuring that beliefs about ourselves are true and by giving up beliefs about ourselves that are false."

On the most sophisticated inferentialist account, due to Paul (2009a), agents take advantage of the special knowledge they have of their intentions to make inferences about what is happening and will happen. Given that intentions are reliably executed, such inferences reliably yield knowledge. A more radical inferentialist alternative, suggested by authors like Carruthers (2011) on the basis of empirical evidence, is that we know our actions on the basis of the same processes by which we know others’ minds: we essentially predict what actions are most likely to happen, given what else we know about others’ motives and beliefs—it’s just that we know a lot more about our own minds. (Similar views about self-knowledge in general are defended by Gopnik 1993, and have their origin in Ryle 1949. For criticisms, see Boyle 2022; Levy 2022.)"

Yet, several challenges have been raised against inferentialist accounts, including: (i) that they can’t explain the tight nexus between intentional action and practical knowledge (Setiya 2007, 2008, 2009); (ii) that they can’t explain the first-personal character of practical knowledge (Wilson 2000; Schwenkler 2012); and (iii) that they at best give us alienated, observational knowledge (Piñeros Glasscock 2021)."

Another view, due to O’Brien (2007), explains practical knowledge in terms of the exercise of deliberative capacities. The agent knows what she is doing because the selection of an action is done via the exercise of capacities that narrow options in terms of the practical possibilities of the agent. Others take practical knowledge to be inferential, but the inference in question is practical inference. On this view, practical knowledge is warranted by the practical considerations that constitute the agent’s practical reasoning (Harman 1997; Tenenbaum 2007; Ross 2009; Marušić and Schwenkler 2018; Campbell 2018; Frey 2019). Finally, some have tried to show that accounts of epistemic warrant or entitlement designed to explain how we can directly believe on the basis of perception might explain how we can directly believe on the basis of our wills (Peacocke 2003; Newstead 2006; Piñeros Glasscock 2020a).

To understand this claim, we first need to explain what the distinction amounts to.

It may be happening in the bathroom in a matter of seconds if Donald stays there; but he could take a break, forget about it, and continue on with it several minutes later in the kitchen. Moreover, the manner in which it takes place can change as it occurs: it may speed up (if Donald is suddenly in a hurry) or slow down (if Donald is distracted by a noise), and he may start doing it more mindfully, or distractedly. Indeed, however Donald is doing the buttering, it may happen that he never ends up having buttered the toast (a nearby scream might cause him to drop it in the toilet halfway through). This is sometimes called the “imperfective paradox”: in general, ⌜x is φ-ing⌝ does not entail ⌜x has φ’d⌝. By contrast, the event itself, denoted by (7), cannot speed up or slow down, nor change the manner in which it is done, since it is already complete. This is why it has a determinate temporal-spatial location in terms of which some have sought to individuate it (Lemmon 1967; Quine 1985; Davidson 1985). By contrast, processes do not have an essential temporal-spatial location: the same process of buttering that is now taking place at 12:01 could culminate in a minute or in an hour."

After all, it seems essential to actions that they can enter into rationalizing explanations (Anscombe 1957; Thompson 2008; Wiland 2013; Ford 2015; 2017), and such explanations can easily be given in imperfective language. To see this, consider again Anscombe’s case of a man who operates a lever to pump poisoned water to a house, with the plan of killing the inhabitants (Anscombe 1957, §23). We could represent his thoughts as follows: “I am moving the lever up and down because I am pumping water to the house because I am poisoning its inhabitants.” Indeed, such formulations seem to express canonical answers to Anscombe’s special question “Why?” (Thompson 2008; Wiland 2013; Ford 2015). However, we cannot capture the same thoughts without imperfective expressions (Thompson 2008). The train of thought that goes, “I have moved the lever up and down because I have pumped the water because I have poisoned the inhabitants of the house” makes it sound like the man is acting on a conditional promise to move the lever if the men are killed by his hand. This suggests that whereas processes can directly enter into the kinds of rationalizing explanations definitive of intentional action, events cannot (except, perhaps, derivatively), which in turn suggests that actions are processes."

And, as Steward (2012) suggests, this might give a substantial role to the agent in the explanation of action.

Moreover, it is worth noting that although the process-view is the most important alternative available to the events-view, other proposals have been advanced recently, including the view that actions are thoughts (Rödl 2007; 2011; Marcus 2012; Valaris 2020).

On this view, A and B are the same action just in case A has all and only the properties that B has; and for each set of such properties, there is an event.

Charles (1984), for example, argues that Aristotle would individuate actions in terms of capacities. This allows us to say that the moving of one’s hands is the same action as the moving of one’s hands quickly (since a single capacity is thereby actualized), even though it is a different action from the poisoning, which actualizes a different set of capacities.

Again, it seems that for an agent to know what she is currently doing, she needs to know how to do the things by which she does it; but unless there is something that she can know how to do just by doing it, it will be impossible for her to know what she is doing at all (Hornsby 2013)."

Many scholars held that simple bodily movements, like moving a finger or raising an eyebrow, were basic, while others held that they could be more complex (tying one’s shoes), or that they must be simpler: perhaps only mental actions, or tryings were basic. After all, I move my finger by attempting to move it; and we need to distinguish between the attempt and the movement, since sometimes the attempt occurs without the movement (e.g. if my fingers are suddenly paralized) (Prichard 1945: Hornsby 1980; O’Shaughnessy 1980; see Cleveland 1997, ch.5 for criticism)."

It is common to draw a three-fold distinction: (i) know-how basicness; (ii) causal basicness; and (iii) teleological basicness. An action is know-how basic iff there is no other (type of) action by which the agent knows how to do the one in question. An action is causally basic iff there is no other (token) action that causes it. An action is teleologically basic iff there is no other (token) action by means of which the agent does it. To illustrate in a way that highlights the differences, consider pitching a baseball. Arguably, this action is know-how basic, since the pitcher may not know a more basic action by which to do it: of course, the agent may know how to move her hands independently, but she may be unable to move her hands in the particular way in which she does when she throws the baseball unless she were actually throwing the baseball. Whether the action is causally basic depends on whether we think there is another action that causes it, such as the pitcher’s moving of his hands. Finally, and independently of the question of causation, the action appears to be teleologically non-basic, since the moving of his hands is certainly both a means and an action by which the pitcher pitches. The consensus for many years was that there must be basic actions in all three senses."

It seems that if P pushed the stone from α to ω intentionally, then he pushed the stone from α to β intentionally. Now, let γ be the halfway point between α and β. Once again, it seems that P pushed the stone from α to γ intentionally. And so on. It seems, then, that there will always be a further action by which P pushed the stone. In other words, there is no basic action. Moreover, as a number of authors have noted (Small 2012; Lavin 2013), the argument can be generalized for virtually every action, since it can be presented in terms of a series of time-segments (instead of place-segments), and virtually every action takes place over time.

The Ontology of Actions,5.3 The Debate Over Basic Action,5,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Building on this argument, Lavin (2013) presents a further challenge to the view that there must be (teleological) basic action. Lavin’s argument centers on the relation of the agent to her actions. Consider first a non-basic action, like poisoning the inhabitants of the house. The agent’s relation to this action is itself an agential matter, since the agent poisons the inhabitants by doing something else intentionally (operating the pump). Now consider an arbitrary basic action, A. By definition, the agent doesn’t do A by doing anything else. However, this is an action that occurs through time, so, presumably there are happenings h1, h2, …, hn by which A takes place. But since h1, h2, …, hn are mere happenings, this means that the agent relates to A non-agentially. Now, Lavin grants that it may be possible sometimes for us to relate to our actions non-agentially; but it would be alarming if this was necessarily the case, as defenders of basic action are committed to hold. It would mean that agents are necessarily alienated from their actions, in the way labourers are alienated from their labour in Marx’s critique of capitalism. In turn, Lavin argues that this would make it impossible for agents to have self-knowledge of their own actions, since self-knowledge is grounded on our agential relation."

This is not surprising, since the debate about basic actions has important repercussions for other questions about the nature of intentional action. For example, Lavin (2013) holds that defenders of (teleologically) basic action are committed to a ”decompositional account“ of agency (see section 1). After all, if there are basic actions, we may be able to give an account of what makes something an action in terms of the non-agential relation an agent bears to her basic actions. Moreover, Ford (2017; 2018) notes that Thompson’s argument suggests a novel way to pursue action theory, one that defines action not in terms of reasons for action but, in the first instance, in terms of the means by which an action is pursued.The latter, Ford holds, better captures the agential perspective: in the context of deliberation, what the agent asks is How to pursue a particular course of action, rather than Why she is doing something. Finally, the debate may have repercussions for our understanding of the relation between skill and intentional action. For example, both Frost and Small suggest that at the most fundamental level, our agency depends on our exercise of practical skills by which we enter an instrumental order without consciously representing that order at the level of propositional thought (Small 2012; 2019; Frost 2019)."

The Ontology of Actions,"5.4 Making, Acting, and the Varieties of Agency",1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Aristotle provides us with an alternative view that has had immense influence in philosophy. Throughout his writings, Aristotle distinguishes between “making” or “producing” (poíêsis) on the one hand, and “acting proper” (praxis) on the other (an early version of the distinction appears in Plato’s Charmides 163a–c). The two are distinguished by their success conditions (EE 5.2/NE 6.2 1139b1–4; EE 5.5/NE 6.5 1140b6–7). The success conditions for makings are external to them: one succeeds at making insofar as something external to the making obtains (the product). By contrast, the success conditions for proper actions are the actions themselves. This is why we pursue them for their own sake (ib.). By this standard, the activities of hammering a nail, or fixing a fridge count as makings, because the hammering is successful insofar as something external takes place: a nail is hammered in a wall, or a fridge is fixed. Precisely because the success conditions are external, it is possible to succeed at making something by luck (EE 5.4/NE 6.4 1140a17–20). By contrast, Aristotle would regard acting justly, keeping a promise, or marrying someone as proper actions. To succeed at these actions consists in doing the actions well. A coerced marriage is not a successful marriage. Hence, these actions cannot be done by luck. This distinction underlies the aforementioned distinction between two forms of human excellence in the practical sphere: skill (technê) is excellence at making (EE 5.4; NE 6.4 1140a6–23), and practical wisdom (phronêsis) is excellence at acting proper (EE 5.5/ NE 6.5 1140a25–30 et passim)."

From his earliest writings, Marx accepts an Aristotelian threefold analysis of labour in terms of the labourer, the process of labouring, and its product. Marx implicitly rejects the distinction between action proper and production, in favour of a dichotomy of his own between different forms of productions. This is because for Marx the characteristic activity of the human species is conscious free labouring: an activity that has no end beyond itself (it does not seek anything beyond the living activity that such labouring consists in) (Marx 1844a; 1844b; 1867). This is what Aristotle took as the distinguishing feature of proper actions, done for their own sake. One of Marx’s central criticisms of capitalist societies is that it prevents humans from engaging in such an activity. In capitalist societies, the labourer, the labour process, and the product all become commodities that serve as mere means for the enjoyment of the owner of labour and product (“the capitalist”). Members of capitalist societies are, in this sense, alienated (Marx 1844b; 1867). As such, capitalist societies make it impossible for humans to engage in their most fundamental life activity of free production, an activity that the Marxist tradition came to designate as “praxis” (Petrovic 1983), reappropriating the quite different Aristotelian notion."

The Ontology of Actions,"5.4 Making, Acting, and the Varieties of Agency",3,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Perhaps the most influential modern version of a distinction among types of practical activity is drawn by Arendt (1998). Arendt distinguishes between three kinds of practical activities: labour, work, and action. The most basic of these is labour, which Arendt conceives as simply an extension of our animal lives: a “metabolism” (Marx’s phrase) between the human animal and the world, characterized by a cycle of consumption and the production of goods to be consumed, and aiming at meeting our basic biological needs (p.69). Since this is a cycle, Arendt suggests that there is no sense of speaking here of means and ends: there is no fact of the matter as to whether the production of goods is for the sake of consumption, or the consumption for the sake of production (p.145; 155). Means and ends enter at the next level of practical activity, work (the Aristotelian poíêsis). Like Aristotle, Arendt takes the aim of working to be the finished work, the product, whether it be a work of art, like a painting, a tool, like a knife, or a way to safeguard living, like a house. The central importance of work lies in its ability to produce lasting products that lie beyond the activity of the producer (p.136; 144). Arendt contends that these products can begin to shape an objective world of objects that stands against the humans who produce them. However, the world does not emerge in its fullness except by way of the third level of practical activity, action (the Aristotelian praxis). Action is the means by which humans reveal themselves in the public sphere, a revelation needed to give reality to a personality that otherwise remains entirely unactualized in subjectivity. It is thus essentially communicative, and depends on other humans to whom one might make herself known (pp.38–49; 95; 202–7); and it depends, given its essential ephemeral nature, for its permanence in the continued existence of a polity that may preserve words and deeds in more enduring forms, like sculptures and tales. Ungoverned by either the natural laws of labor, or by the norms arising from a particular aim, action is for Arendt unproductive, free, and unpredictable. It is the distinguishing activity of human beings as such (p.177; 204–6)."

She criticizes Aristotle both for inconsistently assimilating action too much to work/production in his analysis of benefaction as producing a work (ergon) (p.196), and for subordinating it to theory (22–23). She criticizes Marx’s subsumption of practical activity in general under labour for its failure to provide meaning. She notes that Marx ends in the paradoxical position of concluding that that the aim of labour is freedom from labour, even though this is the activity he takes as definitive of humanity. In other words, Marx ends up concluding that the aim of human life is to do away with human life (p.89; 103; 105). For Arendt, however, this is not merely a theoretical deficiency, but a manifestation of a broader social tendency that goes back to Plato: the tendency to try to make action proper into that which is not—whether work or labour—to control what is essentially unpredictable and free."

Hornsby 2016, Wilson 1980, pp.111–117 for further discussion). Arendt herself thought that this tendency underlay the attraction of utilitarianism, but she argued that, like Marxism, that view was incapable of ever giving further meaning to our practical endeavours (p.105).

On this view, there is no such thing as an aim contained in acting as such; each action just aims at its particular end.

More specifically, it seems that some actions are successful in achieving their particular ends and yet are cases of practical failures in some deeper way, exhibiting what appears like practical irrationality or at least some form of practical ignorance. Suppose I have dreamt all my life to move to Seattle, and I finally secured a position in the city. However, as I arrive in Seattle and try to arrange my life, my life in Seattle is a great disappointment; even though there is nothing important that I found out about Seattle that I didn’t know already, I completely regret having pursued this end.

But how could I go about answering these questions if action did not have a constitutive aim; if there’s nothing that could count as the correct way of answering this question? Similarly, from the point of view of action explanation, some answers seem to provide an intelligible explanation of action while others seem to invite the question “but why would you aim at (want) that?” If you ask me “Why are we eating the jello?”, “Because it is blue” seems to invite further questions, while “Because I find the taste pleasant” brings the inquiry to an end.

Perhaps the most traditional version of this view is the idea that the good is the constitutive aim of agency, possibly going back to Socrates (Protagoras 351a–8e; Gorgias 467c–8d). The notion of “good” involved here can be very thin, meaning no more than “considering matters aright” (Williams 1981) in the realm of practical reason; such views are versions of the thesis often called “the guise of the good” (Tenenbaum 2007; Clark 2010; Schafer 2013). According to the guise of the good, if I φ intentionally, then I must take φ-ing to be good. Arguably some other versions of the constitutive aim of agency are specifications of the thin notion of “good” or “human good” (see Boyle and Lavin 2010). Other constitutive aims that have been defended in literature are self-understanding or autonomy (Velleman 1989; 1992; 1996; 2009), self-constitution (Korsgaard 1996; 2008; 2009), and the will to power (Katsafanas 2013)."

First, suppose we accept the causal theory of action: an intentional action just is the effect of a “primary reason”. On such a view, it seems that an intentional action is constituted by its causal antecedents, rather than by a necessary aim that one has in acting. However, causal theories are not incompatible with constitutivism. Since on these views, some of the causal antecedents of the action will be conative states (like an intention), the question of whether intentional action has a constitutive aim will depend on whether the conative state has a constitutive aim or whether a specific conative state must always figure on the genesis of intentional action. For instance, in Velleman’s early work (for instance, Velleman 1989), intentional action was an action that was caused by a desire for self-knowledge, and the content of such a desire was thus the constitutive aim of agency. Smith (2013; 2015; 2019) also develops a form of constitutivism that endorses the standard story of action."
764,764,Action,6. Constitutive Aim,6.2 Objections,1,action,"First published Wed Jan 11, 2023"," Setiya raises a couple of important challenges to the idea that action has a constitutive aim. According to Setiya (2007), any theory of action needs to account for the fact that practical knowledge (or a belief condition in his version; see section 4 of this entry) is essential to intentional action. However, the belief condition seems to be conceptually independent of any constitutive aim of action, and thus accepting that both are constitutive of intentional action amounts to postulating an unexplained necessary connection."

An intentional action is an action done for an explanatory reason, namely, a reason that explains why the agent acted as she did, in Anscombe’s special sense of the question ‘Why’. However, Setiya points out that an explanatory reason need not be a normative reason; in fact, any reason that the agent believes to be her reason to act can be an explanatory reason, even if the object of such a reason is not good in any way. But since the reasons that explain intentional action need not be good in any way, it seems false that the agent must act only on reasons that she regards to be good in some way, and thus that she aims at the good in acting."

One can argue that a knowledge or belief condition, to the extent that it is valid, is explained by the constitutive aim of action. Moreover, perhaps the possibility of a third-person explanation of an action in terms of explanatory reasons whose objects are not good in any way is compatible with the fact that from the first-person point of view, these objects must have been regarded to be good in some way. So even if the fact that Rugen kills his father explains why Inigo Montoya killed Rugen without providing a normative reason for it, it still might be the case that avenging his father must have appeared good to Inigo Montoya in some way if he killed Rugen intentionally (see Tenenbaum 2012)."

However, none of the things could be plausibly described as cases of omissions or refrainings; it would be odd if I were told that I was refraining from competing in the Olympics or omitting to fly over the moon. Philosophers often describe cases of omissions as cases of my failing to do something that I was somehow “supposed to do” (Bach 2010). Only some of my omissions are intentional or even voluntary: if my alarm does not go off and I miss my class because I overslept, I omitted to teach but not intentionally. On the other hand, if I fail to show up because I am protesting my university’s salary cuts, my omission was intentional. Intentional omissions and (intentional) refrainings are generally taken to be the only possible candidates for being instances of agency among not-doings (see Vermazen 1985 for an expression of this idea). Thus, we will focus on these cases. The categories of intentional omissions and refraining are not necessarily identical.

It seems that in all these cases, the Faculty members are manifesting their agency—they are all equally expressing their dissatisfaction with the cuts—even if Larry does so by (intentionally) not doing something. Such cases of refrainings and intentional omissions seem paradigmatic instances of agency and yet they do not seem to be cases of action: after all, the agent did nothing. But how could the absence of an action be a manifestation of agency? One might be tempted to avoid any puzzling conclusions by simply denying that omissions are absences; by, for instance, proposing that Larry’s intentional omission consists in doing whatever acting he did instead of engaging in the omitted action. So if he goes to the bar instead of going to the holiday party, Larry omits to go to the party by going to the bar and so his going to the bar and his omitting to go to the party are the same event. However, this view immediately encounters difficulties as it seems that I can intentionally omit to do things without engaging in any positive act.

More recently, Alvarez (2013) argues that the fact that omissions and refrainings can also manifest agency is a consequence of the fact that the power to act (intentionally) is a two-way power: a power to either do or not do something.

One possibility is to argue that even though intentional omissions are absences, what makes them intentional is that facts about their causal history are analogous to the facts about causal history that make ”positive actions“ instances of agency (Clarke 2010; 2014). On this view, just as positive actions are caused by an intention, intentional omissions are cases in which the non-obtaining of a certain event is similarly explained by an intention. However, Sartorio (2009) argues that intentional omissions pose a serious challenge even to this broader understanding of the standard causal theory of action. Sartorio argues that intentional omissions are often not best explained by other events (such as the formation of an intention), but by the non-occurrence of certain events (the best explanation of why I omitted to help my friend move might be that I omitted to form the intention to help them, rather than that I did form the intention not to help them). Another strategy to make omissions compatible with the standard causal theory is to try to show that omissions are events, while avoiding the questionable view that the omission must be identified with what the agent intentionally did at the time of the omission (Payton 2021)."

This is because action proper requires the capacity for deliberation, which animals lack. A modern version of this view is defended by Stoecker (2009), who argues that agency presupposes the capacity to act on the basis of ”arguments“ understood as grounds on which one might (reasonably) act. Similar reasons for skepticism about animal agency were influentially advanced by Davidson (1982; 2003). For, as we saw, Davidson takes it that intentional action is action for a reason; but acting for a reason requires possession of beliefs. Yet, Davidson held that ascription of belief makes sense only to beings who possess the concept of belief, which in turn requires the capacity for higher-order thought. Since Davidson assumed that animals possess neither concepts nor the capacity for higher-order thought, he concluded that animals are not capable of intentional action. (Davidson, to our knowledge, does not address the question whether animals are capable of acting simpliciter.

Since animals possess these features, there is an important sense in which they act.

Using a similar strategy, Camp and Shupe (2017) grant that action presupposes the capacity to distinctively represent means and ends but argue that the features presupposed by such a capacity are more minimal than skeptics about animal agency assume: for example, they may include metacognitive resources that keep track of a state without representing it as such."

They are thus capable of acting, even though they lack conceptual representations. The question whether some animals (and, if so, which) have beliefs has also been the subject of debate on the basis of empirical research. While both early and recent studies appeared to support the Davidsonian view that animals lack beliefs (Heyes and Dickinson 1990; Marticorena et al. 2011, Horschler, MacLean, and Santos 2020;), later research complicates the question (de Waal 2016; Krupenye et al. 2016)."

When playing offense, defenders of animal agency commonly appeal to our common ways of speaking and thinking about animals, which, as noted, provide prima facie good grounds to ascribe them agency. In addition, it has been noted that the heightened conditions on agency commonly used to exclude animals would have counterintuitive effects for human actions. After all, many of our human intentional actions (such as habitual actions) do not seem to involve higher-order thought, or previous deliberation (a key insight that leads Hyman 2015 to distinguish different senses of ”acting’)."

See Gustafsson 2016; Marcus 2021). The need to recognize a more basic form of agency can be motivated by noting that otherwise the development of full-fledged human agency becomes developmentally mysterious, both at the inter- and intra-species level. Thus, unless we can ascribe agency to non-rational animals, it will be hard to explain how rational capacities might emerge in humans at the evolutionary level; and unless we ascribe agency to human infants, it will be hard to explain how conceptual capacities emerge (Cussins 1992; MacIntyre 1999; Lovibond 2006; Steward 2009; Fridland 2013)."

According to what they dubbed the “reafference principle” (von Holst & Mittelstädt 1950; von Holst 1954), the visual system exploits a copy of motor directives to the eye in order to distinguish between exafferent visual stimulation, caused by changes in the world, and reafferent visual stimulation, caused by changes in the direction of gaze:"

Signals that predictably come when nothing occurs in the environment are necessarily a result of its own activity, i.e., are reafferences. All signals that come when no commands are given are exafferences and signify changes in the environment or in the state of the organism caused by external forces. … The difference between that which is to be expected as the result of a command and the totality of what is reported by the sensory organs is the proportion of exafference…. It is only this difference to which there are compensatory reflexes; only this difference determines, for example during a moving glance at movable objects, the actually perceived direction of visual objects. This, then, is the solution that we propose, which we have termed the “reafference principle”: distinction of reafference and exafference by a comparison of the total afference with the system’s state—the “command”.

Sensorimotor Contingency Theories,2.1 Efference and Visual Direction Constancy,7,action-perception,"First published Wed Jul 8, 2015","The foregoing solution to the problem of VDC faces challenges on multiple, empirical fronts. First, there is evidence that proprioceptive signals from the extraocular muscles make a non-trivial contribution to estimates of eye position, although the gain of efference copy is approximately 2.4 times greater (Bridgeman & Stark 1991). Second, in the autokinetic effect, a fixed luminous dot appears to wander when the field of view is dark and thus completely unstructured. This finding is inconsistent with theories according to which retinotopic location and efference copy are the sole determinants of eye-relative direction. Third, the hypothesized compensation process, if psychologically real, would be highly inaccurate since subjects fail to notice displacements of the visual world up to 30% of total saccade magnitude (Bridgeman et al. 1975), and the locations of flashed stimuli are systematically misperceived when presented near the time of a saccade (Deubel 2004). Last, when image displacements concurrent with a saccade are large, but just below threshold for detection, visually attended objects appear to “jump” or “jiggle” against a stable background (Brune and Lücking 1969; Bridgeman 1981). Efference copy theories, however, as Bridgeman observes,"

According to this theory, visual attention shifts to the saccade target and a small number of other objects in its vicinity (perhaps four or fewer) before eye movement is initiated. Although little visual scene information is preserved from one fixation to the next, the features of these objects as well as precise information about their presaccadic, eye-relative locations is preserved. After the eye has landed, the visual system searches for the target or one of its neighbors within a limited spatial region around the landing site. If the postsaccadic localization of this “landmark” object succeeds, the world appears to be stable. If this object is not found, however, displacement is perceived. On this approach, efference copy does not directly support VDC. Rather, the role of efference copy is to maintain an estimate of the direction of gaze, which can be integrated with incoming retinal stimulation to determine the static, observer-relative locations of perceived objects. For a recent, philosophically oriented discussion, see Wu 2014."

When post-saccadic object locations are sufficiently congruent with the updated map, stability is perceived. Single-cell and fMRI studies show that neurons at various stages in the visual-processing hierarchy exploit a copy of the saccade command signal in order to shift their receptive field locations in the direction of an impending eye movement microseconds before its initiation (Merriam & Colby 2005; Merriam et al. 2007). Efference copy indicating an impending saccade 20° to the right, in effect, tells relevant neurons: "

Held’s reafference theory goes beyond the account of von Holst and Mittelstädt in three main ways. First, information about movement parameters specified by efference copy is not simply summated with reafferent stimulation. Rather, subjects are assumed to acquire knowledge of the specific sensory consequences of different bodily movements. This knowledge is contained in a hypothesized “correlational storage” area and used to determine whether or not the reafferent stimulations that result from a given type of action match those that resulted in the past (Held 1961: 30). Second, the reafference theory is not limited to eye movements, but extends to “any motor system that can be a source of reafferent visual stimulation”. Third, knowledge of the way reafferent stimulation depends on self-produced movement is used for purposes of sensorimotor control: planning and controlling object-directed actions in the present depends on access to information concerning the visual consequences of performing such actions in the past."

Helmholtz made two additional discoveries. First, there was an intermanual transfer effect: visuomotor adaptation to prisms extended to his non-exposed hand. Second, immediately after removing the prisms from his eyes, errors were made in the opposite direction, i.e., when reaching for a target, Helmholtz now moved his hand too far to the right.

Evidence for this conclusion came from experiments in which participants wore laterally displacing prisms during both active and passive movement conditions. In the active movement condition, the subject moved her visible hand back and forth along a fixed arc in synchrony with a metronome. In the passive movement condition, the subject’s hand was passively moved at the same rate by the experimenters.

First, the theory is an extension of von Holst and Mittelstädt’s reafference principle, according to which efference copy is used to cancel out shifts of the retinal image caused by saccadic eye movements. The latter was specifically intended to explain why we do not experience object displacement in the world whenever we change the direction of gaze. There is nothing, at first blush, however, that is analogous to the putative need for “cancellation” or “discounting” of the retinal image in the case of prism adaptation. As Welch puts it, “There is no visual position constancy here, so why should a model originally devised to explain this constancy be appropriate?” (1978: 16)."

Normally, when engaging in forward locomotion, the perceived radial direction of an object straight ahead of the observer’s body remains constant while the perceived radial directions of objects to either side undergo constant change. This pattern also obtains when the observer wears prisms that displace the retinal image to side. Hence, “an object seen through prisms which retains the same radial direction as we approach must be seen to be moving in toward the sagittal plane” (Rock 1966: 105). On Rock’s view, at least some forms of adaptation to ORDs can be explained by our ability to detect and exploit such invariant sources of spatial informational in locomotion-generated patterns of optic flow."

When this discrepancy is made conspicuous, proponents of the information hypothesis have found that passively moved (Melamed et al. 1973), involuntarily moved (Mather & Lackner 1975), and even immobile subjects (Kravitz & Wallach 1966) exhibit significant adaption. Although self-produced bodily movement is not necessary for adaptation to occur, it provides subjects with especially salient information about the discrepancy between sight and touch (Moulden 1971): subjects are able proprioceptively to determine the location of a moving limb much more accurately than a stationary or passively moved limb. It is the enhancement of the visual-proprioceptive conflict rather than reafferent visual stimulation, on this interpretation, that explains why active movement yields more adaptation than passive movement in Held’s experiments."

In whatever place the tactual impression’s visual counterpart regularly appeared, this would eventually seem the only appropriate place for it to appear in. If we were always to see our bodies a hundred yards away, we would probably also feel them there. (1899: 498, our emphasis)"

As you practice reaching for a target while wearing laterally displacing prisms, for example, the muscle spindles, joint receptors, and Golgi tendon organs in your shoulder and arm continue to generate the same patterns of action potentials as before, but the proprioceptive and kinaesthetic meaning assigned to them by their “consumers” in the brain undergoes change: whereas before they signified that your arm was moving along one path through the seven-dimensional space of possible arm configurations (the human arm has seven degrees of freedom: three at the wrist, one at the elbow, and three at the shoulder), they gradually come to signify that it is moving along a different path in that kinematic space, namely, the one consistent with the prismatically distorted visual feedback you are receiving. Similar recalibrations are possible with respect to sources of information for head and eye position. After adapting to laterally displacing prisms, signals from receptors in your neck that previously signified the alignment of your head and torso, for example, may come to signify that your head is turned slightly to the side.

Noë calls this the object’s “perspectival shape” (P-shape). An object’s visually apparent size, in turn, is the size of the patch projected by the object on the frontal plane. Noë calls this the object’s “perspectival size” (P-size). Appearances are “perceptually basic” (Noë 2004: 81) because in order to see an object’s actual spatial properties it is necessary both to see its 2D P-properties and to understand how they would vary (undergo transformation) with changes in one’s point of view. This conception of what it is to perceive objects as voluminous space-occupiers is closely to akin to views defended by Russell (1918), Broad (1923), and Price (1950).

Quite different, if not incommensurable, notions of sensorimotor profile and, so, of sensorimotor knowledge would thus seem to be implied by the two characterizations."

On this conception there is no commitment to the view that vision is for the guidance of action, that vision constitutively has something to do with adapting animal behavior to the spatial layout of the distal environment (Noë 2004: 18–19). Rather, vision is active in the sense that it involves learned expectations concerning the ways in which sensory stimulations would be “perturbed” by possible bodily movements (Noë 2010: 247–248)."

One of the kittens was able to engage in free circumambulation while wearing a harness. The other kitten was suspended in the air in a metal gondola whose motions were driven by the first harnessed kitten. When the first kitten walked, both kittens moved and received identical visual stimulation. However, only the first kitten received reafferent visual feedback as the result of self-movement. Held and Hein reported that only mobile kittens developed normal depth perception—as evidenced by their unwillingness to step over the edge of a visual cliff, blinking reactions to looming objects, and visually guided paw placing responses.

When we view a tilted coin, critics argue, however, we do not see something that looks—in either an epistemic or non-epistemic sense of “looks”—like an upright ellipse. Rather, we see what looks like a disk that is partly nearer and partly farther away from us. In general, the apparent shapes of the objects we perceive are not 2D but have extension in depth (Austin 1962; Gibson 1979; Smith 2000; Schwitzgebel 2006; Briscoe 2008; Hopp 2013)."

Examples include binocular disparity, vergence, accommodation, motion parallax, texture gradients, occlusion, height in the visual field, relative angular size, reflections, and shading. That such shape-diagnostic information having once been processed by the visual system is not lost in conscious visual experience of the object is shown by standard psychophysical methods in which experimenters manipulate the availability of different spatial depth cues and gauge the perceptual effects. Objects, for example, look somewhat flattened under uniform illumination conditions that eliminate shadows and highlights, and egocentric distances are underestimated for objects positioned beyond the operative range of binocular disparity, accommodation, and vergence. Results of such experimentation show that observers can literally see the difference made by the presence or absence of a certain cue in the light available to the eyes (Smith 2000; Briscoe 2008)."

The conscious experience of seeing an object’s distance, e.g., is constituted by the subject’s learned readiness to perform specific whole body and limb movements that were reinforced when the subject previously received stimulation from objects at the same remove.

While this sort of thing is indeed a problem, it is relatively superficial. Any creature facing this problem must already have the capacity to grasp egocentric spatial location contents, and the problem is which of these ready-at-hand contents it should assign to the stimulus.

I might be able to recognize that a series of moves someone shows me will force my grandmaster opponent into checkmate (knowledge of the first sort, the consequences of a given set of actions), and yet not have been anywhere near the skill level to have come up with that series of moves on my own (knowledge of the second sort, what actions will achieve a desired effect). Sensorimotor contingency theorists appeal to knowledge of the first sort—though as was discussed in Section 2.3.1, Noë flirts with appealing to knowledge of the second sort to explain the perceptual grasp of P-shapes; to the extent he does, he is embracing a disposition theoretic account of P-shapes. Disposition theorists, and bold readiness theorists (Section 3.2.2) appeal to knowledge of the second sort.

Grush (2007: 393) maintains that only the latter are directly relevant for spatial perception. A type-specifying disposition is a disposition to execute some type of behavior with respect to an object or place. For example, an organism might be disposed to grasp, bite, flee, or foveate some object. This sort of disposition is not relevant to the spatial content of the experience on the disposition theory. Rather, what are relevant are detail-specifying dispositions: the specifics of how I am disposed to act to execute any of these behavior types. When reaching to grab the cup to take a drink (type), do I move my hand like so (straight ahead, say), or like such (off to the right)?

The proposal involves more mathematics than is appropriate here, and so a quick qualitative description will have to suffice (for more detail, see Grush 2007; 2009). The basic idea is that relevant cortical areas learn sets of basis functions which, to put it very roughly, encode equivalence classes of combinations of sensory and postural signals (for discussion, see Pouget et al. 2002). For example, many combinations of eye orientation and location of stimulation on the retina correspond to a visual stimulus that is directly in front of the head. Sorting such bodily postural information (not just eye orientation, but any postural information that affects sensation, which is most) and sensory condition pairs into useful equivalence classes is the first half of the job."

The next part corresponds to how this information, so represented, can be used to produce the details of such a motor program. For every type of action in a creature’s behavioral repertoire (grasp, approach, avoid, foveate, bite, etc.) its motor areas have a set of linear coefficients, easily implemented as a set of neural connection strengths, and when these are applied to a set of basis function values, a detailed behavior is specified. For example, when a creature senses an object O1, a set of basis function values B1 for that stimulus is produced. If the creature decides to execute overt action A1, then the B1 basis function values are multiplied by the coefficient corresponding to A1. The result is an instance of behavior type A1 executed with respect to object O1. If the creature had decide instead to execute action A2, with respect to O1, the B1 basis function values would have been multiplied by the A2 set of coefficients, and the result would be a motor behavior executing A2 on object O1."

As discussed above, Evans explicitly claims that the behavioral space is holistically determined by both behavior and perception. And on Grush’s account spatial content is implemented in the construction of basis function values, and these values coordinate transitions from perceptual input to behavioral output. As such, they are highly analogous to inferences whose conditions of application are given in sensory-plus-postural terms and whose consequences of application manifest in behavioral terms. The import of the states that represent these basis function values is no more narrowly motor than the meaning of a conditional can be identified with its consequent (or its antecedent, for that matter) in isolation."

Such objections would, at a minimum, place significant pressure on any views that explain perceptual content by appeal to actual behavior. It is also easy to see how even hypothetical behavior would be called into question in such cases, since in many such cases behavior is not physically possible. Grush’s theory (2007), right or wrong, has something specific to say about this objection. Since spatial content is taken to be manifested in the production of basis function values in the cortex, the prediction is that any impairments manifesting farther down the chain, the brain stem or spinal cord, for example, need have no direct effect on spatial content. So long as the relevant brain areas have the wherewithal to produce sets of basis function values suitable for constructing a motor sequence (if multiplied by the action-type-specific coefficients), then the occasioning perceptual episode will have spatial content."

A well-known example is David Bohm's (1951) version of the famous thought experiment that Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen proposed in 1935 (henceforth, the EPR/B experiment). Pairs of particles are emitted from a source in the so-called spin singlet state and rush in opposite directions (see Fig. 1 below). When the particles are widely separated from each other, they each encounter a measuring apparatus that can be set to measure their spin components along various directions. Although the measurement events are distant from each other, so that no slower-than-light or light signal can travel between them, the measurement outcomes are curiously  correlated.[1]  That is, while the outcome of each of the distant spin measurements seems to be a matter of pure chance, they are correlated with each other: The joint probability of the distant outcomes is different from the product of their single probabilities. For example, the probability that each of the particles will spin clockwise about the z-axis in a z-spin measurement (i.e., a measurement of the spin component along the z direction) appears to be ½. Yet, the outcomes of such measurements are perfectly anti-correlated: If the left-hand-side (L-) particle happens to spin clockwise (anti-clockwise) about the z-axis, the right-hand-side (R-) particle will spin anti-clockwise (clockwise) about that axis.

If, for example, the first measurement is a z-spin measurement on the L-particle, the L-particle will spin either clockwise or anti-clockwise about the z-axis with equal chance. And the outcome of the L-measurement causes an instantaneous change in the spin properties of the distant R-particle. If the L-particle spins clockwise (anti-clockwise) about the z-axis, the R-particle will instantly spin anti-clockwise (clockwise) about the same axis.

On this instrumental interpretation, the predictions of quantum mechanics are not an adequate basis for any conclusion about non-locality: This theory is just an incredible oracle (or a crystal ball), which provides a very successful algorithm for predicting measurement outcomes and their probabilities, but it offers little information about ontological matters, such as the nature of objects, properties and causation in the quantum realm."
950,950,Action at a Distance in Quantum Mechanics,1. Introduction,,26,qm-action-distance,"First published Fri Jan 26, 2007","  Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (1935) thought that quantum mechanics is incomplete and that the curious correlations between distant systems do not amount to action at a distance between them. The apparent instantaneous change in the R-particle's properties during the L-measurement is not really a change of properties, but rather a change of knowledge. (For more about the EPR argument, see the entry on the EPR argument, Redhead 1987, chapter 3, and Albert 1992, chapter 3. For discussions of the EPR argument in the relativistic context, see Ghirardi and Grassi 1994 and Redhead and La Riviere 1997.) On this view, quantum states of systems do not always reflect their complete state. Quantum states of systems generally provide information about some of the properties that systems possess and information about the probabilities of outcomes of measurements on them, and this information does not generally reflect the complete state of the systems. In particular, the information encoded in the spin singlet state is about the probabilities of measurement outcomes of spin properties in various directions, about the conditional probabilities that the L- (R-) particle has a certain spin property given that the R- (L-) particle has another spin property, and about the anti-correlation between the spins that the particles may have in any given direction (for more details, see section 5.1). Thus, the outcome of a z-spin measurement on the L-particle and the spin singlet state (interpreted as a state of knowledge) jointly provide information about the z-spin property of the R-particle. For example, if the outcome of the L-measurement is z-spin ‘up,’ we know that the R-particle has z-spin ‘down’; and if we assume, as EPR did, that there is no curious action at a distance between the distant wings (and that the change of the quantum-mechanical state of the particle pair in the L-measurement is only a change in state of knowledge), we could also conclude that the R-particle had z-spin ‘down’ even before the L-measurement occurs."

More particularly, the question is whether it is possible to construct a local, common-cause model of the EPR/B experiment, i.e., a model that postulates no influence between systems/events in the distant wings of the experiment, and that the correlation between them are due to the state of the particle pair at the source. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen believed that this is possible. But, as John Bell demonstrated in 1964, this belief is difficult to uphold."

But due to technological advances, various versions of this experiment have been conducted since the 1970s, and their results have overwhelmingly supported the quantum-mechanical predictions (for brief reviews of these experiments and further references, see the entry on Bell's theorem and Redhead 1987, chapter 4, section 4.3 and ‘Notes and References’).

By contrast, in local models of this experiment the correlations are supposed to be accounted for by a common cause—the pair's state λ (see Fig. 2 below): The pair's state and the L-setting determine the probability of the L-outcome; the pair's state and the R-setting determine the probability of the R-outcome; and the pair's state and the L- and the R-setting determine the probability of joint outcomes, which (as mentioned above) is simply the product of these single probabilities. The idea is that the probability of each of the outcomes is determined by ‘local events,’ i.e., events that are confined to its backward light-cone, and which can only exert subluminal or luminal influences on it (see Figure 3 below); and the distant outcomes are fundamentally independent of each other, and thus their joint probability factorizes.

967,967,Action at a Distance in Quantum Mechanics,2. Bell's theorem and non-locality,,43,qm-action-distance,"First published Fri Jan 26, 2007","  Another possible explanation for the failure of λ-independence is that the apparatus settings influence the pair's state at the source, and accordingly the distribution of the possible pairs' states λ is dependent upon the settings. Since the settings can be made after the emission of the particle pair from the source, this kind of violation of λ-independence would require backward causation. (For advocates of this way out of non-locality, see Costa de Beauregard 1977, 1979, 1985, Sutherland 1983, 1998, 2006 and Price 1984, 1994, 1996, chapters 3, 8 and 9.) On some readings of John Cramer's (1980, 1986) transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (see Maudlin 1994, pp. 197-199), such violation of λ-independence is postulated. According to this interpretation, the source sends ‘offer’ waves forward to the measurement apparatuses, and the apparatuses send ‘confirmation’ waves (from the space-time regions of the measurement events) backward to the source, thus affecting the states of emitted pairs according to the settings of the apparatuses.  The question of whether such a theory can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics is a controversial matter (see Maudlin 1994, pp. 197-199, Berkovitz 2002, section 5, and Kastner 2006). It is noteworthy, however, that while the violation of λ-independence is sufficient for circumventing Bell's theorem, the failure of this condition per se does not substantiate locality. The challenge of providing a local model of the EPR/B experiment also applies to models that violate λ-independence. (For more about these issues, see sections 9 and 10.3.)"

This theory postulates that in non-measurement interactions, the evolution of states obeys a linear and unitary equation of motion, the so-called Schrödinger equation (see the entry on quantum mechanics), according to which the particle pair in the EPR/B experiment remains in an entangled state. This equation of motion also dictates that in a spin measurement, the pointers of the measurement apparatuses get entangled with the particle pair in a non-separable state in which (according to the theory's property assignment, see below) the indefiniteness of particles’ spins is ‘transmitted’ to the pointer's position: In this entangled state of the particle pair and the pointer, the pointer lacks any definite position, in contradiction to our experience of perceiving it pointing to either ‘up’ or ‘down.’"

Accordingly, microscopic systems may be in a state of indefinite z-spin, energy, position, momentum and various other quantities. The problem is that given the linear and unitary Schrödinger dynamics, these indefinite quantities are also endemic in the macroscopic realm. For example, in a z-spin measurement on a particle in a superposition state of z-spin ‘up’ and z-spin ‘down,’ the position of the apparatus’s pointer gets entangled with the indefinite z-spin of the particle, thus transforming the pointer into a state of indefinite position, i.e., a superposition of pointing ‘up’ and pointing ‘down’ (see Albert 1992, chapter 4, and the entry on collapse theories, section 3).
