## WORK IN PROGRESS

I am writing software to prompt GPT (or any language model with a nice API) to answer Philosophy questions with reference to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (one of the best online resources!). 

Will update as the architecture takes shape, but for now, most of my effort has been in cleaning some very strangely formatted data.


# Embeddings Cost:

First going to do ~1141 embeddings to see how much this costs via the OpenAI API. Hopefully like a penny lol

It cost 5 cents


164,300 is the full data.

IT SHOULD COST $6 for the full embedding then!
